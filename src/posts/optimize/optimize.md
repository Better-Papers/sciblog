<!-- First, we assume that {captureEff}%
of cells are captured into droplets.
On average, for a given GEM bead, there are
$Î» = \frac{n_\mathrm{cell}}{n_\mathrm{GEM}}$
cells and is distributed as a Poisson distribution.
However, we care about cells, not empty droplets.
Therefore, we're going to ignore all empty droplets and use the
[zero-truncated Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-truncated_Poisson_distribution)
to calculate the expected recovery of singlets. -->
