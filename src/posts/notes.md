### Chapter 22: Ruthless Beats Reasonable

1998 memo by the American Petroleum Institute:
opposing emission limits solely on economic grounds is not enough
because that makes it too easy for others to protray the United States
as putting preservation of its own lifestyle over the greater concerns of mankind.
Rather, let's make a case into scientific uncertainty with the goal of
making uncertainties in climate science part of the conventional for the average citizen.

2002 memo by Frank Lutz: use climate change instead of global warming
because global warming has "catastrophic communications" attached to it.

Since 2017, Kochs' spending on U.S. academia has been $100M a year.
