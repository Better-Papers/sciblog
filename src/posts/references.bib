  abstract = {Although Mg2+ is an important cofactor for the specific degradation of RNA by ribozymes, it is not considered as a typical chemical nuclease. In this study we show that in combination with common buffers such as tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane and sodium borate, Mg2+ is a powerful catalyst for the degradation of RNA. pH and temperature are found to be the principal factors for the efficient degradation of RNA. Whereas in Tris-HCl/Mg2+ the efficient cleavage starts at pH values higher than 7.5 and temperatures higher than 37 degrees C, in sodium borate RNA degradation begins at pH 7.0 and at 37 degrees C. RNA hydrolysis promoted under the combined catalytic activity of buffer/Mg2+ results in partially degraded RNA and negligible amounts of acid-soluble material. Reaction is insensitive to the concentration of monovalent cations but is completely prevented by chelating agents (EDTA and citrate) at concentrations exceeding that of Mg2+. Borate-magnesium reaction is inhibited also by some polyvalent alcohols (glycerol) and sugars.},

  abstract = {It has been just over 10 years since the initial description of transposase-based methods to prepare high-throughput sequencing libraries, or "tagmentation," in which a hyperactive transposase is used to simultaneously fragment target DNA and append universal adapter sequences. Tagmentation effectively replaced a series of processing steps in traditional workflows with one single reaction. It is the simplicity, coupled with the high efficiency of tagmentation, that has made it a favored means of sequencing library construction and fueled a diverse range of adaptations to assay a variety of molecular properties. In recent years, this has been centered in the single-cell space with a catalog of tagmentation-based assays that have been developed, covering a substantial swath of the regulatory landscape. To date, there have been a number of excellent reviews on single-cell technologies structured around the molecular properties that can be profiled. This review is instead framed around the central components and properties of tagmentation and how they have enabled the development of innovative molecular tools to probe the regulatory landscape of single cells. Furthermore, the granular specifics on cell throughput or richness of data provided by the extensive list of individual technologies are not discussed. Such metrics are rapidly changing and highly sample specific and are better left to studies that directly compare technologies for assays against one another in a rigorously controlled framework. The hope for this review is that, in laying out the diversity of molecular techniques at each stage of these assay platforms, new ideas may arise for others to pursue that will further advance the field of single-cell genomics.},

Here we describe a metabolomics method for the analysis of rare cell populations isolated directly from tissues and use it to compare mouse haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to restricted haematopoietic progenitors. Each haematopoietic cell type had a distinct metabolic signature. Human and mouse HSCs had unusually high levels of ascorbate, which decreased with differentiation. Systemic ascorbate depletion in mice increased HSC frequency and function, in part by reducing the function of Tet2, a dioxygenase tumour suppressor. Ascorbate depletion cooperated with Flt3 internal tandem duplication (Flt3ITD) leukaemic mutations to accelerate leukaemogenesis, through cell-autonomous and possibly non-cell-autonomous mechanisms, in a manner that was reversed by dietary ascorbate. Ascorbate acted cell-autonomously to negatively regulate HSC function and myelopoiesis through Tet2-dependent and Tet2-independent mechanisms. Ascorbate therefore accumulates within HSCs to promote Tet activity in vivo, limiting HSC frequency and suppressing leukaemogenesis.},

  abstract = {This article introduces Vivarium\textemdash software born of the idea that it should be as easy as possible for computational biologists to define any imaginable mechanistic model, combine it with existing models and execute them together as an integrated multiscale model. Integrative multiscale modeling confronts the complexity of biology by combining heterogeneous datasets and diverse modeling strategies into unified representations. These integrated models are then run to simulate how the hypothesized mechanisms operate as a whole. But building such models has been a labor-intensive process that requires many contributors, and they are still primarily developed on a case-by-case basis with each project starting anew. New software tools that streamline the integrative modeling effort and facilitate collaboration are therefore essential for future computational biologists.Vivarium is a software tool for building integrative multiscale models. It provides an interface that makes individual models into modules that can be wired together in large composite models, parallelized across multiple CPUs and run with Vivarium's discrete-event simulation engine. Vivarium's utility is demonstrated by building composite models that combine several modeling frameworks: agent-based models, ordinary differential equations, stochastic reaction systems, constraint-based models, solid-body physics and spatial diffusion. This demonstrates just the beginning of what is possible\textemdash Vivarium will be able to support future efforts that integrate many more types of models and at many more biological scales.The specific models, simulation pipelines and notebooks developed for this article are all available at the vivarium-notebooks repository: https://github.com/vivarium-collective/vivarium-notebooks.

In the last decades, the developmental neurobiology field has made important progress in understanding neural cell-type specification: key patterning mechanisms were discovered, the different waves of neurogenesis described, and the dynamics of cortical stratification elucidated. However, only recently, with the advent of single-cell genomics and organoid culturing methods, we were able to measure the transcriptional signatures of individual progenitors systematically and flexibly perturb human development. Together these fine-grained readouts and perturbation possibilities have allowed comparing neural differentiation between species and dissecting the relationship between progenitors' phenotype and fate commitment. This review summarizes recent in~vivo and in~vitro studies that have contributed to our understanding of temporal progression and coordination of neuronal cell specification across mammals.},

In this Perspective, we describe an emerging `differentiable biology' in which phenomena ranging from the small and specific (for example, one experimental assay) to the broad and complex (for example, protein folding) can be modeled effectively and efficiently, often by exploiting knowledge about basic natural phenomena to overcome the limitations of sparse, incomplete and noisy data. By distilling differentiable biology into a small set of conceptual primitives and illustrative vignettes, we show how it can help to address long-standing challenges in integrating multimodal data from diverse experiments across biological scales.

In this paper, we develop a novel approach to determine cell-cycle parameters in specific classes of neural stem and progenitor cells, identified by molecular markers rather than location. We found that G1 lengthening was associated with the transition from stem cell-like apical progenitors to fate-restricted basal (intermediate) progenitors. Unexpectedly, expanding apical and basal progenitors exhibit a substantially longer S-phase than apical and basal progenitors committed to neuron production. Comparative genome-wide gene expression analysis of expanding versus committed progenitor cells revealed changes in key factors of cell-cycle regulation, DNA replication and repair and chromatin remodelling. Our findings suggest that expanding neural stem and progenitor cells invest more time during S-phase into quality control of replicated DNA than those committed to neuron production.},

Our approach provides a global view of cellular chromatome under normal physiological conditions and enables the identification of chromatin-bound proteins de novo. Integrating Dm-ChP with genomic and functional data, we have discovered an unexpected chromatin function for adenosylhomocysteinase, a major one-carbon pathway metabolic enzyme, in gene activation.

However, several key factors in the RD histone biosynthesis pathway are up-regulated by E2F or phosphorylated by CDK2, suggesting these processes may instead begin much earlier, at the point of cell-cycle commitment. In this study, we use both fixed- and live-cell imaging of human cells to address this question, revealing a hybrid model in which RD histone biosynthesis is first initiated in G1, followed by a strong increase in histone production in S phase of the cell cycle. This suggests a mechanism by which cells that have committed to the cell cycle build up an initial small pool of RD histones to be available for the start of DNA replication, before producing most of the necessary histones required in S phase. Thus, a clear distinction exists at completion of mitosis between cells that are born with the intention of proceeding through the cell cycle and replicating their DNA and cells that have chosen to exit the cell cycle and have no immediate need for histone synthesis.}

We have adapted a method for histological tissue fixation using dithio-bis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP), or Lomant's Reagent, to stabilise cell samples for single-cell transcriptomic applications. DSP is a reversible cross-linker of free amine groups that has previously been shown to preserve tissue integrity for histology while maintaining RNA integrity and yield in bulk RNA extractions. Although RNA-seq data from DSP-fixed single cells appears to be prone to characteristic artefacts, such as slightly reduced yield of cDNA and a detectable 3{${'}$} bias in comparison with fresh cells, cell preservation using DSP does not appear to substantially reduce RNA complexity at the gene level. In addition, there is evidence that instantaneous fixation of cells can reduce inter-cell technical variability. The ability of DSP-fixed cells to retain commonly used dyes, such as propidium iodide, enables the tracking of experimental sub-populations and the recording of cell viability at the point of fixation. Preserving cells using DSP will remove several barriers in the staging of single-cell experiments, including the transport of samples and the scheduling of shared equipment for downstream single-cell isolation and processing.},

The limited correlations observed between mRNA and protein abundance suggest pervasive regulation of post-transcriptional steps and support the importance of profiling mRNA levels in parallel to protein synthesis and degradation rates. In this work, we applied an integrative multi-omic approach to study gene expression along the mammalian cell cycle through side-by-side analysis of mRNA, translation and protein levels. Our analysis sheds new light on the significant contribution of both protein synthesis and degradation to the variance in protein expression. Furthermore, we find that translation regulation plays an important role at S-phase, while progression through mitosis is predominantly controlled by changes in either mRNA levels or protein stability. Specific molecular functions are found to be co-regulated and share similar patterns of mRNA, translation and protein expression along the cell cycle. Notably, these include genes and entire pathways not previously implicated in cell cycle progression, demonstrating the potential of this approach to identify novel regulatory mechanisms beyond those revealed by traditional expression profiling. Through this three-level analysis, we characterize different mechanisms of gene expression, discover new cycling gene products and highlight the importance and utility of combining datasets generated using different techniques that monitor distinct steps of gene expression.},

  abstract = {How noncoding DNA determines gene expression in different cell types is a major unsolved problem, and critical downstream applications in human genetics depend on improved solutions. Here, we report substantially improved gene expression prediction accuracy from DNA sequences through the use of a deep learning architecture, called Enformer, that is able to integrate information from long-range interactions (up to 100\,kb away) in the genome. This improvement yielded more accurate variant effect predictions on gene expression for both natural genetic variants and saturation mutagenesis measured by massively parallel reporter assays. Furthermore, Enformer learned to predict enhancer\textendash promoter interactions directly from the DNA sequence competitively with methods that take direct experimental data as input. We expect that these advances will enable more effective fine-mapping of human disease associations and provide a framework to interpret cis-regulatory evolution.},

In this paper, we report on a new instrument to assess this: the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Individuals score in the range 0\textendash 50. Four groups of subjects were assessed: Group 1: 58 adults with Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA); Group 2: 174 randomly selected controls. Group 3: 840 students in Cambridge University; and Group 4: 16 winners of the UK Mathematics Olympiad. The adults with AS/HFA had a mean AQ score of 35.8 (SD = 6.5), significantly higher than Group 2 controls (M = 16.4, SD = 6.3). 80\% of the adults with AS/HFA scored 32+, versus 2\% of controls. Among the controls, men scored slightly but significantly higher than women. No women scored extremely highly (AQ score 34+) whereas 4\% of men did so. Twice as many men (40\%) as women (21\%) scored at intermediate levels (AQ score 20+). Among the AS/HFA group, male and female scores did not differ significantly. The students in Cambridge University did not differ from the randomly selected control group, but scientists (including mathematicians) scored significantly higher than both humanities and social sciences students, confirming an earlier study that autistic conditions are associated with scientific skills. Within the sciences, mathematicians scored highest. This was replicated in Group 4, the Mathematics Olympiad winners scoring significantly higher than the male Cambridge humanities students. 6\% of the student sample scored 327plus; on the AQ. On interview, 11 out of 11 of these met three or more DSM-IV criteria for AS/HFA, and all were studying sciences/mathematics, and 7 of the 11 met threshold on these criteria. Test\textemdash retest and interrater reliability of the AQ was good. The AQ is thus a valuable instrument for rapidly quantifying where any given individual is situated on the continuum from autism to normality. Its potential for screening for autism spectrum conditions in adults of normal intelligence remains to be fully explored.},

The ED theory has difficulty explaining the existence of talent in ASC. While both hyper-systemizing and WCC theories postulate excellent attention to detail, by itself excellent attention to detail will not produce talent. By contrast, the hyper-systemizing theory argues that the excellent attention to detail is directed towards detecting `if p, then q' rules (or [input\textendash operation\textendash output] reasoning). Such law-based pattern recognition systems can produce talent in systemizable domains. Finally, we argue that the excellent attention to detail in ASC is itself a consequence of sensory hypersensitivity. We review an experiment from our laboratory demonstrating sensory hypersensitivity detection thresholds in vision. We conclude that the origins of the association between autism and talent begin at the sensory level, include excellent attention to detail and end with hyper-systemizing.},

Width is a function of biological heterogeneity plus extrinsic and intrinsic error sources associated with the measurement process. Optimal cytometer performance minimizes extrinsic error, but reducing intrinsic error to the point of facilitating peak resolution requires careful fluorochrome selection and fluorescent cell sorting. In this study, we labeled the Jurkat and A549 cell lines with CFSE, CellTraceViolet (CTV), and eFluor 670 proliferation dye (EPD) to test if we could resolve division peaks in culture after reducing the labeled input widths by cell sorting. Reanalysis of the sorted populations to ascertain the level of reduction achieved always led to widths exceeding the gated limits due to the contribution of errors. Measuring detector-specific extrinsic error by sorting uniform fluorescent particles with similar spectral properties to the tracking dyes allowed us to determine the intrinsic error for each dye and cell type using a simple mathematical approach. We found that cell intrinsic error ultimately dictated whether we could resolve division peaks, and that as this increased, the required sort gate width to resolve any division peaks decreased to the point whereby issues with yield made A549 unsuitable for this approach. Finally, attempts to improve yields by setting two concurrent sort gates on the fluorescence distribution enriched for cells in different stages of the cell cycle that had nonequivalent proliferative properties in culture and thus should be practiced with caution. \textcopyright{} 2013 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},

  abstract = {The central nervous system (CNS) exhibits an extraordinary diversity of neurons, with the right cell types and proportions at the appropriate sites. Thus, to produce brains with specific size and cell composition, the rates of proliferation and differentiation must be tightly coordinated and balanced during development. Early on, proliferation dominates; later on, the growth rate almost ceases as more cells differentiate and exit the cell cycle. Generation of cell diversity and morphogenesis takes place concomitantly. In the vertebrate brain, this results in dramatic changes in the position of progenitor cells and their neuronal derivatives, whereas in the spinal cord morphogenetic changes are not so important because the structure mainly grows by increasing its volume. Morphogenesis is under control of specific genetic programs that coordinately unfold over time; however, little is known about how they operate and impact in the pools of progenitor cells in the CNS. Thus, the spatiotemporal coordination of these processes is fundamental for generating functional neuronal networks. Some key aims in developmental neurobiology are to determine how cell diversity arises from pluripotent progenitor cells, and how the progenitor potential changes upon time. In this review, we will share our view on how the advance of new technologies provides novel data that challenge some of the current hypothesis. We will cover some of the latest studies on cell lineage tracing and clonal analyses addressing the role of distinct progenitor cell division modes in balancing the rate of proliferation and differentiation during brain morphogenesis. We will discuss different hypothesis proposed to explain how progenitor cell diversity is generated and how they challenged prevailing concepts and raised new questions.}

The duration of S phase is fairly constant within a given cell type, but remarkably plastic during development, cell differentiation or various stresses. Characterizing the dynamics of S phase is important as replication defects are associated with genome instability, cancer and ageing. Methods to measure S-phase duration are so far indirect, and rely on mathematical modelling or require cell synchronization. We describe here a simple and robust method to measure S-phase duration in cell cultures using a dual EdU-BrdU pulse-labeling regimen with incremental thymidine chases, and quantification by flow cytometry of cells entering and exiting S phase. Importantly, the method requires neither cell synchronization nor genome engineering, thus avoiding possible artifacts. It measures the duration of unperturbed S phases, but also the effect of drugs or mutations on it. We show that this method can be used for both adherent and suspension cells, cell lines and primary cells of different types from human, mouse and Drosophila. Interestingly, the method revealed that several commonly-used cancer cell lines have a longer S phase compared to untransformed cells.},

We have developed an immunolabeling method that utilizes a high salt buffer to stabilize RNA during prolonged antibody incubations. We first assessed RNA integrity by three methods and found that tissue incubated in high salt buffer for at least 20 h yielded RNA of similar quality to that for RNA extracted from fresh-frozen tissue, which is considered highest quality. Notably, the integrity was superior to that for RNA extracted from tissue processed using rapid immunolabeling procedures (5 min total duration). We next established that high salt buffer was compatible with immunolabeling, as demonstrated by immunofluorescent detection of dopamine neurons in the brain. Finally, we laser microdissected dopamine neurons that were immunolabeled using high salt buffer and demonstrated that RNA integrity was preserved. Our described method yields high quality RNA from immunolabeled microdissected cells, an essential requirement for meaningful genomics investigations of normal and pathological cells isolated from complex tissues.},

Each published experiment becomes a historical document; it relies on past research (the ``Introduction'' section), procedures developed in the past (``Methods'' section) and as soon as new data are published, they become history and become embedded into the history of the discipline (``Discussion'' section). In order to be transparent and able to be replicated, each experiment requires its own historical archive. Studying history means researching books, documents and objects in libraries, archives, and museums. It means looking at data books, letters and memos, talking to scientists, and reading biographies and autobiographies. History can be made relevant by integrating historical documents into classes and by using historical websites.

  abstract = {We have examined the salt and temperature dependences of the equilibrium binding of the Escherichia coli single strand binding (SSB) tetramer to a series of oligodeoxythymidylates, dT(pT)N-1, with N = 16, 28, 35, 56 and 70. Absolute binding isotherms were obtained, based on the quenching of the intrinsic protein fluorescence upon formation of the complexes. The shorter oligonucleotides, with N = 16, 28 and 35, bind to multiple sites on the SSB tetramer and negative co-operativity is observed among these binding sites. We have quantitatively analyzed these isotherms, using a statistical thermodynamic (``square'') model to obtain the intrinsic binding constant, KN, and the negative co-operativity constant, {$\sigma$}N. For all oligonucleotides, we find that KN decreases significantly with increasing concentration of monovalent salt, indicating a large electrostatic component to the free energy of the interaction (e.g. {$\partial$}log KN{$\partial$}log [NaBr] = -2.7, -4.6 and -7.1 for N = 16, 35 and 70, respectively), with contributions from both cations and anions. For oligonucleotides that span two or more subunits, there is a significant unfavorable contribution to the binding free energy for each intersubunit crossing, with an accompanying uptake of anions. Therefore, the extent of anion uptake increases as the number of intersubunit crossings increase. There is a strong temperature dependence for the intrinsic binding of dT(pT)15, such that {$\Delta$}H0 = -26({$\pm$} 3) kcal/mol dT(pT)15. Negative co-operativity exists under all solution conditions tested, i.e. {$\sigma$}N {$<$} 1, and this is independent of anion concentration and type. However, the negative co-operativity constant does decrease with decreasing concentration of cation. The dependence of {$\sigma$}16 on Na+ concentration indicates that an average of one sodium ion is taken up as a result of the negative co-operativity between two dT(pT)15 binding sites. These data and the lack of a temperature dependence for {$\sigma$}16 suggest that the molecular basis for the negative co-operativity is predominantly electrostatic and may be due to the repulsion of regions of single-stranded DNA that are required to bind in close proximity on an individual SSB tetramer.},

We used kBET to assess commonly used batch-regression and normalization approaches, and to quantify the extent to which they remove batch effects while preserving biological variability. We also demonstrate the application of kBET to data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors to distinguish cell-type-specific inter-individual variability from changes in relative proportions of cell populations.

We investigated the response of oligo-conjugated antibodies towards four variables: concentration, staining volume, cell number at staining, and tissue. We find that staining with recommended antibody concentrations causes unnecessarily high background and amount of antibody used can be drastically reduced without loss of biological information. Reducing staining volume only affects antibodies targeting abundant epitopes used at low concentrations and is counteracted by reducing cell numbers. Adjusting concentrations increases signal, lowers background, and reduces costs. Background signal can account for a major fraction of total sequencing and is primarily derived from antibodies used at high concentrations. This study provides new insight into titration response and background of oligo-conjugated antibodies and offers concrete guidelines to improve such panels.},

  abstract = {Robust brain development requires the tight coordination between tissue growth, neuronal differentiation and stem cell maintenance. To achieve this, neural stem cells need to balance symmetric proliferative and terminal divisions with asymmetric divisions. In recent years, the unequal distribution of certain cellular components in mitosis has emerged as a key mechanism to regulate the symmetry of division, and the determination of equal and unequal sister cell fates. Examples of such components include polarity proteins, signaling components, and cellular structures such as endosomes and centrosomes. In several types of neural stem cells, these factors show specific patterns of inheritance that correlate to specific cell fates, albeit the underlying mechanism and the potential causal relationship is not always understood. Here, we review these examples of cellular neural stem and progenitor cell asymmetries and will discuss how they fit into our current understanding of neural stem cell function in neurogenesis in developing and adult brains. We will focus mainly on the vertebrate brain, though we will incorporate relevant examples from invertebrate organisms as well. In particular, we will highlight recent advances in our understanding of the complexities related cellular asymmetries in determining division mode outcomes, and how these mechanisms are spatiotemporally regulated to match the different needs for proliferation and differentiation as the brain forms.}

We develop PIDC, a fast, efficient algorithm that uses partial information decomposition (PID) to identify regulatory relationships between genes. We thoroughly evaluate the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate that the higher-order information captured by PIDC allows it to outperform pairwise mutual information-based algorithms when recovering true relationships present in simulated data. We also infer gene regulatory networks from three experimental single-cell datasets and illustrate how network context, choices made during analysis, and sources of variability affect network inference. PIDC tutorials and open-source software for estimating PID are available.

  abstract = {A simple method for extraction of high quality RNA from cells that have been fixed, stained and sorted by flow cytometry would allow routine transcriptome analysis of highly purified cell populations and single cells. However, formaldehyde fixation impairs RNA extraction and inhibits RNA amplification. Here we show that good quality RNA can be readily extracted from stained and sorted mammalian cells if formaldehyde is replaced by glyoxal\textemdash a well-characterised fixative that is widely compatible with immunofluorescent staining methods. Although both formaldehyde and glyoxal efficiently form protein-protein crosslinks, glyoxal does not crosslink RNA to proteins nor form stable RNA adducts, ensuring that RNA remains accessible and amenable to enzymatic manipulation after glyoxal fixation. We find that RNA integrity is maintained through glyoxal fixation, permeabilisation with methanol or saponin, indirect immunofluorescent staining and flow sorting. RNA can then be extracted by standard methods and processed into RNA-seq libraries using commercial kits; mRNA abundances measured by poly(A)+ RNA-seq correlate well between freshly harvested cells and fixed, stained and sorted cells. We validate the applicability of this approach to flow cytometry by staining MCF-7 cells for the intracellular G2/M-specific antigen cyclin B1 (CCNB1), and show strong enrichment for G2/M-phase cells based on transcriptomic data. Switching to glyoxal fixation with RNA-compatible staining methods requires only minor adjustments of most existing staining and sorting protocols, and should facilitate routine transcriptomic analysis of sorted cells.},

  abstract = {Single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) has greatly advanced our ability to characterize cellular heterogeneity1. However, scRNA-seq requires lysing cells, which impedes further molecular or functional analyses on the same cells. Here, we established Live-seq, a single-cell transcriptome profiling approach that preserves cell viability during RNA extraction using fluidic force microscopy2,3, thus allowing to couple a cell's ground-state transcriptome to its downstream molecular or phenotypic behaviour. To benchmark Live-seq, we used cell growth, functional responses and whole-cell transcriptome read-outs to demonstrate that Live-seq can accurately stratify diverse cell types and states without inducing major cellular perturbations. As a proof of concept, we show that Live-seq can be used to directly map a cell's trajectory by sequentially profiling the transcriptomes of individual macrophages before and after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, and of adipose stromal cells pre- and post-differentiation. In addition, we demonstrate that Live-seq can function as a transcriptomic recorder by preregistering the transcriptomes of individual macrophages that were subsequently monitored by time-lapse imaging after LPS exposure. This enabled the unsupervised, genome-wide ranking of genes on the basis of their ability to affect macrophage LPS response heterogeneity, revealing basal Nfkbia expression level and cell cycle state as important phenotypic determinants, which we experimentally validated. Thus, Live-seq can address a broad range of biological questions by transforming scRNA-seq from an end-point to a temporal analysis approach.},

  abstract = {Background Interest in single-cell transcriptomic analysis is growing rapidly, especially for profiling rare or heterogeneous populations of cells. In almost all reported works investigators have used live cells, which introduces cell stress during preparation and hinders complex study designs. Recent studies have indicated that cells fixed by denaturing fixative can be used in single-cell sequencing, however they did not usually work with most types of primary cells including immune cells. Methods The methanol-fixation and new processing method was introduced to preserve human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) analysis on 10\texttimes{} Chromium platform. Results When methanol fixation protocol was broken up into three steps: fixation, storage and rehydration, we found that PBMC RNA was degraded during rehydration with PBS, not at cell fixation and up to 3-month storage steps. Resuspension but not rehydration in 3\texttimes{} saline sodium citrate (SSC) buffer instead of PBS preserved PBMC RNA integrity and prevented RNA leakage. Diluted SSC buffer did not interfere with full-length cDNA synthesis. The methanol-fixed PBMCs resuspended in 3\texttimes{} SSC were successfully implemented into 10\texttimes{} Chromium standard scRNA-seq workflows with no elevated low quality cells and cell doublets. The fixation process did not alter the single-cell transcriptional profiles and gene expression levels. Major subpopulations classified by marker genes could be identified in fixed PBMCs at a similar proportion as in live PBMCs. This new fixation processing protocol also worked in several other fixed primary cell types and cell lines as in live ones. Conclusions We expect that the methanol-based cell fixation procedure presented here will allow better and more effective batching schemes for a complex single cell experimental design with primary cells or tissues.

  abstract = {Early-stage human embryogenesis, such as implantation, gastrulation, and neurulation, are critical for successful pregnancy. For decades, our knowledge about these stages has been limited by the inaccessibility to such embryo specimens in vivo and the difficulty in rebuilding them in vitro. Although human embryos could be cultured in vitro beyond implantation, it remains challenging for the cultured embryos to recapitulate the continuous, coordinated morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation as seen in vivo. Stem cell-based embryo models, mainly derived from human pluripotent stem cells, are organized structures mimicking essential developmental processes in the early-stage human embryos. Despite their invaluable potentials, most embryo models are based on the self-organization of human pluripotent stem cells, which are limited in controllability, reproducibility, and developmental fidelity. Recently, the integration of bioengineered tools and stem cell biology has fueled a technological transformation towards programmable, highly complex, high-fidelity stem cell-based embryo models. Given its scientific and clinical significance, we present an overview of recent paradigm-shifting advances as well as historical perspectives regarding the past, present, and future of synthetic human embryology. Following the developmental roadmap of human embryogenesis, we critically review existing stem cell-based models for implantation, gastrulation, and neurulation, respectively. We highlight the limitations encountered by autonomous self-organization strategy and discuss the concept and application of guided cell organization as a game-changer for innovating next-generation embryo models. Future endeavors in synthetic human embryology should rationally leverage both the self-organizing power and programmable microenvironmental guidance to secure faithful reconstructions of the hierarchical orders of human embryogenesis in vitro.},

Popular advice frequently departs from normative principles derived from economic theory, which should motivate new hypotheses about why households make the financial choices they do, as well as what financial choices households should make. Popular advice is sometimes driven by fallacies, but it tries to take into account the limited willpower individuals have to stick to a financial plan, and its recommended actions are often easily computable by ordinary individuals. I cover advice on savings rates, the advisability of being a wealthy hand-to-mouth consumer, asset allocation, non-mortgage debt management, simultaneous holding of high-interest debt and low-interest savings, and mortgage choices.},

  abstract = {DNA is naturally well suited to serve as a digital medium for in vivo molecular recording. However, contemporary DNA-based memory devices are constrained in terms of the number of distinct `symbols' that can be concurrently recorded and/or by a failure to capture the order in which events occur1. Here we describe DNA Typewriter, a general system for in vivo molecular recording that overcomes these and other limitations. For DNA Typewriter, the blank recording medium (`DNA Tape') consists of a tandem array of partial CRISPR\textendash Cas9 target sites, with all but the first site truncated at their 5{${'}$}\,ends and therefore inactive. Short insertional edits serve as symbols that record the identity of the prime editing guide RNA2 mediating the edit while also shifting the position of the `type guide' by one unit along the DNA Tape, that is, sequential genome editing. In this proof of concept of DNA Typewriter, we demonstrate recording and decoding of thousands of symbols, complex event histories and short text messages; evaluate the performance of dozens of orthogonal tapes; and construct `long tape' potentially capable of recording as many as 20 serial events. Finally, we leverage DNA Typewriter in conjunction with single-cell RNA-seq to reconstruct a monophyletic lineage of 3,257 cells and find that the Poisson-like accumulation of sequential edits to multicopy DNA tape can be maintained across at least 20 generations and 25 days of in vitro clonal expansion.},

This wealth of biological information calls for novel strategies to integrate such information in a meaningful, predictive and experimentally verifiable way. In this Perspective we explain how executable computational models meet this need. Such models provide a means for comprehensive data integration, can be experimentally validated, are readily interpreted both biologically and clinically, and have the potential to predict effective therapies for different cancer types and subtypes. We explain what executable models are and how they can be used to represent the dynamic biological behaviours inherent in cancer, and demonstrate how such models, when coupled with automated reasoning, facilitate our understanding of the mechanisms by which oncogenic signalling pathways regulate tumours. We explore how executable models have impacted the field of cancer research and argue that extending them to represent a tumour in a specific patient (that is, an avatar) will pave the way for improved personalized treatments and precision medicine. Finally, we highlight some of the ongoing challenges in developing executable models and stress that effective cross-disciplinary efforts are key to forward progress in the field.},

  abstract = {How the shape of embryos and organs emerges during development is a fundamental question that has fascinated scientists for centuries. Tissue dynamics arise from a small set of cell behaviours, including shape changes, cell contact remodelling, cell migration, cell division and cell extrusion. These behaviours require control over cell mechanics, namely active stresses associated with protrusive, contractile and adhesive forces, and hydrostatic pressure, as well as material properties of cells that dictate how cells respond to active stresses. In this Review, we address how cell mechanics and the associated cell behaviours are robustly organized in space and time during tissue morphogenesis. We first outline how not only gene expression and the resulting biochemical cues, but also mechanics and geometry act as sources of morphogenetic information to ultimately define the time and length scales of the cell behaviours driving morphogenesis. Next, we present two idealized modes of how this information flows \textemdash{} how it is read out and translated into a biological effect \textemdash{} during morphogenesis. The first, akin to a programme, follows deterministic rules and is hierarchical. The second follows the principles of self-organization, which rests on statistical rules characterizing the system's composition and configuration, local interactions and feedback. We discuss the contribution of these two modes to the mechanisms of four very general classes of tissue deformation, namely tissue folding and invagination, tissue flow and extension, tissue hollowing and, finally, tissue branching. Overall, we suggest a conceptual framework for understanding morphogenetic information that encapsulates genetics and biochemistry as well as mechanics and geometry as information modules, and the interplay of deterministic and self-organized mechanisms of their deployment, thereby diverging considerably from the traditional notion that shape is fully encoded and determined by genes.},

Recent single-cell transcriptomic data provide new opportunities for quantifying this originally conceptual tool, offering insight into the gene regulatory networks underlying cellular development. While many methods for constructing the landscape have been proposed, by far the most commonly employed approach is based on computing the landscape as the negative logarithm of the steady-state probability distribution. Here, we use simple models to highlight the complexities and limitations that arise when reconstructing the potential landscape in the presence of stochastic fluctuations. We consider how the landscape changes in accordance with different stochastic systems and show that it is the subtle interplay between the deterministic and stochastic components of the system that ultimately shapes the landscape. We further discuss how~the presence of noise has important implications for the identifiability of the regulatory dynamics from experimental data.

The construction of high-fidelity models will require hundreds/thousands of cycles of model improvement, yet few current systems biology research studies complete even a single cycle. We combined multiple software tools with integrated laboratory robotics to execute three cycles of model improvement of the prototypical eukaryotic cellular transformation, the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) diauxic shift. In the first cycle, a model outperforming the best previous diauxic shift model was developed using bioinformatic and systems biology tools. In the second cycle, the model was further improved using automatically planned experiments. In the third cycle, hypothesis-led experiments improved the model to a greater extent than achieved using high-throughput experiments. All of the experiments were formalized and communicated to a cloud laboratory automation system (Eve) for automatic execution, and the results stored on the semantic web for reuse. The final model adds a substantial amount of knowledge about the yeast diauxic shift: 92 genes (+45\%), and 1,048 interactions (+147\%). This knowledge is also relevant to understanding cancer, the immune system, and aging. We conclude that systems biology software tools can be combined and integrated with laboratory robots in closed-loop cycles.},

To enable cost-effective single-cell sequencing for millions of individual cells, we developed `single-cell combinatorial fluidic indexing' (scifi). The scifi-RNA-seq assay combines one-step combinatorial preindexing of entire transcriptomes inside permeabilized cells with subsequent single-cell RNA-seq using microfluidics. Preindexing allows us to load several cells per droplet and computationally demultiplex their individual expression profiles. Thereby, scifi-RNA-seq massively increases the throughput of droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq, and provides a straightforward way of multiplexing thousands of samples in a single experiment. Compared with multiround combinatorial indexing, scifi-RNA-seq provides an easy and efficient workflow. Compared to cell hashing methods, which flag and discard droplets containing more than one cell, scifi-RNA-seq resolves and retains individual transcriptomes from overloaded droplets. We benchmarked scifi-RNA-seq on various human and mouse cell lines, validated it for primary human T cells and applied it in a highly multiplexed CRISPR screen with single-cell transcriptome readout of T cell receptor activation.},

To increase the scale of these atlases, lower the cost and pave the way for more specialized multiome assays, custom droplet microfluidics may provide solutions complementary to commercial setups. We developed HyDrop, a flexible and open-source droplet microfluidic platform encompassing three protocols. The first protocol involves creating dissolvable hydrogel beads with custom oligos that can be released in the droplets. In the second protocol, we demonstrate the use of these beads for HyDrop-ATAC, a low-cost noncommercial scATAC-seq protocol in droplets. After validating HyDrop-ATAC, we applied it to flash-frozen mouse cortex and generated 7996 high-quality single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles in a single run. In the third protocol, we adapt both the reaction chemistry and the capture sequence of the barcoded hydrogel bead to capture mRNA, and demonstrate a significant improvement in throughput and sensitivity compared to previous open-source droplet-based scRNA-seq assays (Drop-seq and inDrop). Similarly, we applied HyDrop-RNA to flash-frozen mouse cortex and generated 9508 single-cell transcriptomes closely matching reference single-cell gene expression data. Finally, we leveraged HyDrop-RNA's high capture rate to analyze a small population of fluorescence-activated cell sorted neurons from the Drosophila brain, confirming the protocol's applicability to low input samples and small cells. HyDrop is currently capable of generating single-cell data in high throughput and at a reduced cost compared to commercial methods, and we envision that HyDrop can be further developed to be compatible with novel (multi) omics protocols.},

These issues range from determining when and how deep to profile cells, linking cells within and between time points, learning continuous trajectories, and integrating bulk and single-cell data for reconstructing models of dynamic networks. In this Review, we discuss several approaches for the analysis and modelling of time-series scRNA-seq, highlighting their steps, key assumptions, and the types of data and biological questions they are most appropriate for.},

There are now many reasons to reject this classical hypothesis. Not only is it incompatible with recent phylogenetic analyses, but it is also an artifact of `hidden biology', that is, blind spots to complex traits in non-model species. A new hypothesis of animal evolution, where many complex traits have been repeatedly gained and lost, is emerging. As we discuss here, key details of this new model hinge on a better understanding of the Porifera and Ctenophora, which have each been hypothesized to be sister to all other animals, but are poorly studied and often misrepresented.},

We generated a mouse strain expressing an H2B-FT fusion reporter from a universally active locus and demonstrate that faster cycling cells can be distinguished from slower cycling ones on the basis of the intracellular fluorescence ratio between the FT's blue and red states. Using this reporter, we reveal the native cell cycle speed distributions of fresh hematopoietic cells and demonstrate its utility in analyzing cell proliferation in solid tissues. This system is broadly applicable for dissecting functional heterogeneity associated with cell cycle dynamics in complex tissues.},

Despite the acknowledged technical advantages to this approach, RNA-seq library preparation remains mostly conducted by core facilities rather than in the laboratory due to the infrastructure, expertise and time required per sample. We have recently described two `click-chemistry' based library construction methods termed ClickSeq and Poly(A)-ClickSeq (PAC-seq) as alternatives to conventional RNA-seq that are both cost effective and rely on straightforward reagents readily available to most labs. ClickSeq is random-primed and can sequence any (unfragmented) RNA template, while PAC-seq is targeted to poly(A) tails of mRNAs. Here, we further develop PAC-seq as a platform that allows for simultaneous mapping of poly(A) sites and the measurement of differential expression of genes. We provide a detailed protocol, descriptions of appropriate computational pipelines, and a proof-of-principle dataset to illustrate the technique. PAC-seq offers a unique advantage over other 3{${'}$} end mapping protocols in that it does not require additional purification, selection, or fragmentation steps allowing sample preparation directly from crude total cellular RNA. We have shown that PAC-seq is able to accurately and sensitively count transcripts for differential gene expression analysis, as well as identify alternative poly(A) sites and determine the precise nucleotides of the poly(A) tail boundaries.},

Recent progress in computational cognitive accounts of emotion promises to answer these questions with greater conceptual precision informed by normative principles and neurobiological data. We analyze this literature using the formalism of reinforcement learning and find that emotions may implement three classes of computations, concerning expected reward, evaluation of actions, and uncertain prospects. With regards to each of these computations, we offer modifications of previous formulations that better account for existing evidence. We then consider how these different computations may map onto different emotions and moods. Integrating extensive research on the causes and consequences of different emotions suggests a parsimonious one-to-one mapping, according to which emotions are integral to how we evaluate outcomes (pleasure \& pain), learn to predict them (happiness \& sadness), use them to inform our (frustration \& content) and others' (anger \& gratitude) actions, and plan in order to realize (desire \& hope) or avoid (fear \& anxiety) uncertain outcomes.},

Whilst there is extensive anatomical data on these dividing cells, limited gene transcription data is available due to technical constraints. New method We focally isolated dividing cells whilst conserving RNA, from culture, primary neural tissue and xenografted glioma tumours, using a thymidine analogue that enables gene transcription analysis. Results 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine labels the replicating DNA of dividing cells. Once labelled, cultured cells and tissues were dissociated, fluorescently tagged with a revised click chemistry technique and the dividing cells isolated using fluorescence-assisted cell sorting. RNA was extracted and analysed using real time PCR. Proliferation and maturation related gene expression in neurogenic tissues was demonstrated in acutely and 3 day old labelled cells, respectively. An elevated expression of marker and pathway genes was demonstrated in the dividing cells of xenografted brain tumours, with the non-dividing cells showing relatively low levels of expression. Comparison with existing method BrdU ``immune-labelling'', the most frequently used protocol for detecting cell proliferation, causes complete denaturation of RNA, precluding gene transcription analysis. This EdU labelling technique, maintained cell integrity during dissociation, minimized copper exposure during labelling and used a cell isolation protocol that avoided cell lysis, thus conserving RNA. Conclusions The technique conserves RNA, enabling the definition of cell proliferation-related changes in gene transcription of neural and pathological brain cells in cells harvested immediately after division, or following a period of maturation.},

One such approach is graphical network modeling, which provides a computational framework to explicitly model the molecular interactions within and between the cells comprising biological systems. These graphical networks aim to describe a putative chain of cause and effect between interacting molecules. This feature allows for determination of key molecules in a biological process, accelerated generation of mechanistic hypotheses, and simulation of experimental outcomes. We review the computational concepts and applications of graphical network models across molecular scales for both intracellular and intercellular regulatory biology, examples of successful applications, and the future directions needed to overcome current limitations.},

We identify nine progenitor populations physically proximal to the telencephalon, suggesting more heterogeneity than previously described, including a highly prevalent mesenchymal-like population that disappears once neurogenesis begins. Comparison of human and mouse progenitor populations at corresponding stages identifies two progenitor clusters that are enriched in the early stages of human cortical development. We also find that organoid systems display low fidelity to neuroepithelial and early radial glia cell types, but improve as neurogenesis progresses. Overall, we provide a comprehensive molecular and spatial atlas of early stages of human brain and cortical development.},

  abstract = {Radial glial progenitor cells (RGCs) in the dorsal telencephalon directly or indirectly produce excitatory projection neurons and macroglia of the neocortex. Recent evidence shows that the pool of RGCs is more heterogeneous than originally thought and that progenitor subpopulations can generate particular neuronal cell types. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we have studied gene expression patterns of RGCs with different neurogenic behavior at early stages of cortical development. At this early age, some RGCs rapidly produce postmitotic neurons, whereas others self-renew and undergo neurogenic divisions at a later age. We have identified candidate genes that are differentially expressed among these early RGC subpopulations, including the transcription factor Sox9. Using in utero electroporation in embryonic mice of either sex, we demonstrate that elevated Sox9 expression in progenitors affects RGC cell cycle duration and leads to the generation of upper layer cortical neurons. Our data thus reveal molecular differences between progenitor cells with different neurogenic behavior at early stages of corticogenesis and indicates that Sox9 is critical for the maintenance of RGCs to regulate the generation of upper layer neurons. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The existence of heterogeneity in the pool of RGCs and its relationship with the generation of cellular diversity in the cerebral cortex has been an interesting topic of debate for many years. Here we describe the existence of RGCs with reduced neurogenic behavior at early embryonic ages presenting a particular molecular signature. This molecular signature consists of differential expression of some genes including the transcription factor Sox9, which has been found to be a specific regulator of this subpopulation of progenitor cells. Functional experiments perturbing expression levels of Sox9 reveal its instructive role in the regulation of the neurogenic behavior of RGCs and its relationship with the generation of upper layer projection neurons at later ages.},

  abstract = {RNA is a tool used in many fields, from molecular and cellular biology to medicine and nanotechnology. For most of these uses, the integrity of RNA is required and must be maintained during storage. Even though freezing is currently the storage method of choice, the increasing number of samples to be stored and the costly use of a cold chain have highlighted the need for room temperature preservation methods. Here, we report a new room temperature technology that consists in drying RNA samples in the presence of a stabilizer in stainless steel minicapsules. These air- and water-tight capsules isolate RNA from the atmosphere and maintain an anhydrous and anoxic environment. Through the evaluation of RNA integrity over time at room temperature or 90\,\textdegree C, we identified atmospheric humidity as a major deleterious factor. The degradation rate dependence in temperature fitted an Arrhenius model, with an activation energy of 28.5\,kcal/mol and an extrapolated room temperature degradation rate of 3.2 10-13/nt/s (95\% confidence interval: 2.3\textendash 4.2/nt/s). In these conditions, it is expected that an RNA molecule will be subjected to 0.7\textendash 1.3 cut every 1000 nucleotides per century. In addition, we showed that stored RNA is compatible for further analyses, such as reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. No significant change in the Cq values was observed over a simulated period of several decades. At last, our data are consistent with a sequence-independent degradation rate of RNA in the solid state.},

Although techniques have been developed to assess binding profiles within a population of cells, determining them at a single-cell level remains elusive. Here, we report scFAN (single-cell factor analysis network), a deep learning model that predicts genome-wide TF binding profiles in individual cells. scFAN is pretrained on genome-wide bulk assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq), DNA sequence, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data and uses single-cell ATAC-seq to predict TF binding in individual cells. We demonstrate the efficacy of scFAN by both studying sequence motifs enriched within predicted binding peaks and using predicted TFs for discovering cell types. We develop a new metric "TF activity score" to characterize each cell and show that activity scores can reliably capture cell identities. scFAN allows us to discover and study cellular identities and heterogeneity based on chromatin accessibility profiles.},

  abstract = {Naive T lymphocytes have the potential to differentiate and produce a range of cytokines crucial for appropriate immune responses. How T lymphocytes vary their cytokine output during differentiation is unknown, although they are clearly influenced by the cytokines already present in the environment. Here we show that the number of divisions taken by the cells after activation is a critical element in T cell differentiation. Our experiments used the dye 5-(and 6-)carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester to track cells in different divisions after activation by anti-CD3 in the presence of the differentiating cytokine interleukin (IL)-4. The patterns of acquisition or loss of secretion of IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and interferon {$\gamma$} all varied markedly with division number. These relationships were consistent regardless of the time-dependent variation in distribution of T cells among divisions. Thus, the observed combination of complex asynchronous T cell growth, overlaying a fixed probability of acquisition or loss of a cytokine at each division can explain why T cell differentiation displays the contradictory features of being both highly stochastic and highly controlled. Furthermore, these data reveal that T cells share a common regulatory strategy with B cells, whereby changes in the class of immune response are linked to the process of clonal expansion.}

We compare properties of DTT and TCEP important in protein biochemistry, using the motor enzyme myosin as an example protein. The reductants equally preserve myosin's enzymatic activity, which is sensitive to sulfhydryl oxidation. When labeling with extrinsic probes, DTT inhibits maleimide attachment to myosin and must be removed before labeling. In contrast, maleimide attachment to myosin was achieved in the presence of TCEP, although with less efficiency than no reductant. Surprisingly, iodoacetamide attachment to myosin was nearly unaffected by either reductant at low (0.1 mM) concentrations. In electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy utilizing nitroxide spin labels, TCEP is highly advantageous: spin labels are two to four times more stable in TCEP than DTT, thereby alleviating a long-standing problem in EPR. During protein purification, Ni2+ concentrations contaminating proteins eluted from Ni2+ affinity columns cause rapid oxidation of DTT without affecting TCEP. For long-term storage of proteins, TCEP is significantly more stable than DTT without metal chelates such as EGTA in the buffer, whereas DTT is more stable if metal chelates are present. Thus TCEP has advantages over DTT, although the choice of reductant is application specific.},

Using 23 markers, we defined groups of proteins controlled predominantly by division state or time and found that undivided cells account for the majority of phenotypic diversity. We next built a map of cell state changes during naive T-cell expansion. By examining cell signaling on this map, we rationally selected ibrutinib, a BTK and ITK inhibitor, and administered it before T cell activation to direct differentiation toward a T stem cell memory (TSCM)-like phenotype. This method for tracing cell fate across division states and time can be broadly applied for directing cellular differentiation.},

For both regions data were collected resulting from in vitro and in vivo transposition events. Since the data sets are consistent and transposase was the only protein present in vitro, this demonstrates that target selection is a property of only transposase. There appear to be two factors governing target selection. A target consensus sequence, which presumably reflects the target selection of individual pairs of Tn5/IS50 bound transposase protomers, was deduced by analyzing all insertion sites. The consensus Tn5/IS50 target site is A-GNTYWRANC-T. However, we observed that independent insertion sites tend to form groups of closely located insertions (clusters), and insertions very often were spaced in a 5-bp periodic fashion. This suggests that Tn5/IS50 target selection is facilitated by more than two transposase protomers binding to the DNA, and, thus, for a site to be a good target, the overlapping neighboring DNA should be a good target, too. Synthetic target sequences were designed and used to test and confirm this model.}

This protocol describes a fluorescence birth-dating technique to label, track and isolate isochronic cohorts of newborn cells in the CNS in vivo in mouse embryos. Injection of carboxyfluorescein esters (CFSEs) into the cerebral ventricle allows pulse labeling of mitotic (M phase) ventricular zone (VZ) progenitors and their progeny across the CNS, a procedure we termed FlashTag. Specificity for M-phase apical progenitors is a result of the somata of these cells transiently contacting the ventricular wall during this cell-cycle phase, exposing them to CFSE injected into the cerebrospinal fluid. Using this approach, the developmental trajectory of progenitors and their daughter neurons can be tracked. Labeled cells can be imaged ex vivo or in fixed tissue, targeted for electrophysiological experiments or isolated using FACS for cell culture or (single-cell) RNA sequencing. Multiple embryos can be labeled within 30 min. The dye is retained for several weeks, allowing labeled cells to be identified postnatally. This protocol describes the labeling procedure using in utero injection, the isolation of live cells using FACS and the processing of labeled tissue for immunohistochemistry.},

Global gene expression can be quantified from the number of reads mapping to each gene, and mutations and mRNA splicing variants determined from the sequence reads. Here we demonstrate that this method of transcriptomic analysis can be done using the extremely low levels of mRNA in a single nucleus, isolated from a mouse neural progenitor cell line and from dissected hippocampal tissue. This method is characterized by excellent coverage and technical reproducibility. On average, more than 16,000 of the 24,057 mouse protein-coding genes were detected from single nuclei, and the amount of gene-expression variation was similar when measured between single nuclei and single cells. Several major advantages of the method exist: first, nuclei, compared with whole cells, have the advantage of being easily isolated from complex tissues and organs, such as those in the CNS. Second, the method can be widely applied to eukaryotic species, including those of different kingdoms. The method also provides insight into regulatory mechanisms specific to the nucleus. Finally, the method enables dissection of regulatory events at the single-cell level; pooling of 10 nuclei or 10 cells obscures some of the variability measured in transcript levels, implying that single nuclei and cells will be extremely useful in revealing the physiological state and interconnectedness of gene regulation in a manner that avoids the masking inherent to conventional transcriptomics using bulk cells or tissues.}

The main critical step in single-cell transcriptomics is sample preparation. Several methods have been developed to preserve cells after sample dissociation to uncouple sample handling from library preparation. Yet, the suitability of these methods depends on the types of cells to be processed. In this project, we perform a systematic comparison of preservation methods for droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) on neural and glial cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. We compared the cellular composition and expression profile of single-cell suspensions from fresh NPCs with that of NPCs preserved with Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO), Methanol, vivoPHIX and Acetil-methanol (ACME). Our results show that while DMSO provides the highest cell quality in terms of RNA molecules and genes detected per cell, it strongly affects the cellular composition and the expression profile of the resulting datasets. In contrast, methanol fixed samples display a cellular composition like that of fresh samples while providing a good cell quality and smaller expression biases. Taken together, our results show that methanol fixation is the method of choice for performing droplet-based single-cell transcriptomics experiments on neural cell populations.},

Most studies of cognitive change are constrained, however, in their ability to detect subtle, but theoretically informative life-span changes, as they rely on either comparing broad age groups or sparse sampling across the age range. Here, we present convergent evidence from 48,537 online participants and a comprehensive analysis of normative data from standardized IQ and memory tests. Our results reveal considerable heterogeneity in when cognitive abilities peak: Some abilities peak and begin to decline around high school graduation; some abilities plateau in early adulthood, beginning to decline in subjects? 30s; and still others do not peak until subjects reach their 40s or later. These findings motivate a nuanced theory of maturation and age-related decline, in which multiple, dissociable factors differentially affect different domains of cognition.},

  abstract = {Background Labeling cells with 5-(and-6) carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) allows their subsequent division history to be determined by flow cytometry. Whether nuclei isolated from CFSE-labeled cells retain any or sufficient dye to reveal the same division history was unknown. If division tracking in nuclei were possible, it would enable the development of new methods for monitoring quantitative changes in nuclei components and how these might vary with successive divisions. Methods Nuclei from CFSE-labeled B cells were prepared by lysing whole cells with nonionic detergent Nonidet P-40 (NP-40). The purified nuclei were subsequently fixed with paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with Tween 20 in order to perform intranuclear staining. Results Purified nuclei displayed the equivalent asynchronous cell division profile as intact cells. Furthermore, the possibility of simultaneously monitoring division history with intranuclear staining was established by labeling bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporated into DNA during a brief pulse prior to harvesting cells. This result was verified with the staining of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). In addition, aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) staining established that cell cycle stage and cell division history could be simultaneously determined. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that cell division history is retained in purified cell nuclei after CFSE labeling and can be used in combination with intranuclear immunofluorescent labeling and DNA staining to provide a comprehensive analysis of nuclei by flow cytometry. This method should prove useful for assessing differential nuclear translocation and accumulation of molecular components during consecutive division rounds and during different stages of the cell cycle.

Therefore, we investigated EdU's potential cytotoxic and mutagenic effects and its related underlying mechanisms when administered to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) wild type and DNA repair-deficient cells. EdU treatment displayed a higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity than BrdU treatment. Cells with defective homologous recombination repair displayed a greater growth delay and severe inhibition of clonogenicity with EdU compared to wild type and other DNA repair-deficient cells. Inductions of sister chromatid exchange and hypoxanthine phosphorybosyl transferase (HPRT) mutation were observed in EdU-incorporated cells as well.

Does the brain use similar brute-force fitting processes to learn how to perceive and act upon the world? Recent advances in artificial neural networks have exposed the power of optimizing millions of synaptic weights over millions of observations to operate robustly in real-world contexts. These models do not learn simple, human-interpretable rules or representations of the world; rather, they use local computations to interpolate over task-relevant manifolds in a high-dimensional parameter space. Counterintuitively, similar to evolutionary processes, over-parameterized models can be simple and parsimonious, as they provide a versatile, robust solution for learning a diverse set of functions. This new family of direct-fit models present a radical challenge to many of the theoretical assumptions in psychology and neuroscience. At the same time, this shift in perspective establishes unexpected links with developmental and ecological psychology.},

We first established that the free energy landscape obtained in the simulations is in excellent agreement with the single-molecule optical tweezer experiments. The origin of the stronger stability in sodium compared to potassium is found to be due to the differences in the charge density\textendash related binding modes. The smaller hydrated sodium ion preferentially binds to the highly charged phosphates that have high surface area. In contrast, the larger potassium ions interact with the major grooves. As a result, more cations condense around phosphate groups in the case of sodium ions, leading to the reduction of electrostatic repulsion. Because the proposed mechanism is generic, we predict that the same conclusions are valid for divalent alkaline earth metal cations., All-atom simulations of RNA unfolding highlight the critical role(s) played by charge density.},

In 12,024 patients and 18,969 controls from the ENIGMA consortium, we observed that co-alteration patterns followed normative connectome organization and were anchored to prefrontal and temporal disease epicenters. Manifold learning revealed frontal-to-temporal and sensory/limbic-to-occipitoparietal transdiagnostic gradients, differentiating shared illness effects on cortical thickness along these axes. The principal gradient aligned with a normative cortical thickness covariance gradient and established a transcriptomic link to cortico-cerebello-thalamic circuits. Moreover, transdiagnostic gradients segregated functional networks involved in basic sensory, attentional/perceptual, and domain-general cognitive processes, and distinguished between regional cytoarchitectonic profiles. Together, our findings indicate that shared illness effects occur in a synchronized fashion and along multiple levels of hierarchical cortical organization.},

To address this gap, we analyzed large-scale genetic screens performed in human cell lines using either nuclease-active or nuclease-dead Cas9 (dCas9). We observed that highly active sgRNAs for Cas9 and dCas9 were found almost exclusively in regions of low nucleosome occupancy. In vitro experiments demonstrated that nucleosomes in fact directly impede Cas9 binding and cleavage, while chromatin remodeling can restore Cas9 access. Our results reveal a critical role of eukaryotic chromatin in dictating the targeting specificity of this transplanted bacterial enzyme, and provide rules for selecting Cas9 target sites distinct from and complementary to those based on sequence properties.},

Understanding the heritability and asymmetry of phenotypic changes throughout this process requires determination of clonal-level contributions to fate selection.

In this study, we introduce a novel, accessible, high-throughput method for measuring familial fate changes with accompanying statistical tools for testing hypotheses. The method combines multiplexing of division tracking dyes with detection of phenotypic markers to reveal clonal lineage properties. We illustrate the method by studying in vitro\textendash activated mouse CD8+ T cell cultures, reporting division and phenotypic changes at the level of families. This approach has broad utility as it is flexible and adaptable to many cell types and to modifications of in vitro, and potentially in vivo, fate monitoring systems.},

However, the impact of team diversity on team outcomes and moderating variables potentially affecting this relationship are still not fully answered with mixed findings in the literature. These research issues were, therefore, addressed by quantitatively reviewing extant work and provided estimates of the relationship between team diversity and team outcomes. In particular, the effects of task-related and bio-demographic diversity at the group-level were meta-analyzed to test the hypothesis of synergistic performance resulting from diverse employee teams. Support was found for the positive impact of task-related diversity on team performance although bio-demographic diversity was not significantly related to team performance. Similarly, no discernible effect of team diversity was found on social integration. The implications of the review for future research and practices are also discussed.},

Yet, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which DDX3X controls cortical development are largely unknown. Here, using a mouse model of Ddx3x loss-of-function we demonstrate that DDX3X directs translational and cell cycle control of neural progenitors, which underlies precise corticogenesis. First, we show brain development is sensitive to Ddx3x dosage; complete Ddx3x loss from neural progenitors causes microcephaly in females, whereas hemizygous males and heterozygous females show reduced neurogenesis without marked microcephaly. In addition, Ddx3x loss is sexually dimorphic, as its paralog, Ddx3y, compensates for Ddx3x in the developing male neocortex. Using live imaging of progenitors, we show that DDX3X promotes neuronal generation by regulating both cell cycle duration and neurogenic divisions. Finally, we use ribosome profiling in vivo to discover the repertoire of translated transcripts in neural progenitors, including those which are DDX3X-dependent and essential for neurogenesis. Our study reveals invaluable new insights into the etiology of DDX3X syndrome, implicating dysregulated progenitor cell cycle dynamics and translation as pathogenic mechanisms.},

Here, we introduce SCITO-seq, a workflow that uses splint oligonucleotides (oligos) to enable combinatorially indexed dsc-seq of DNA-barcoded antibodies from over 105 cells per reaction using commercial microfluidics. By encoding sample barcodes into splint oligos, we demonstrate that multiplexed SCITO-seq produces reproducible estimates of cellular composition and surface protein expression comparable to those from mass cytometry. We further demonstrate two modified splint oligo designs that extend SCITO-seq to achieve compatibility with commercial DNA-barcoded antibodies and simultaneous expression profiling of the transcriptome and surface proteins from the same cell. These results demonstrate SCITO-seq as a flexible and ultra-high-throughput platform for sequencing-based single-cell protein and multimodal profiling.},

The carboxy-fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeling experiment is one such assay that is widely used to study cell kinetics and as a standard tool for investigating lymphocyte proliferation. Several mathematical models have been proposed to describe cell proliferation during CFSE experiments. The statistical analysis of CFSE-labeling data has received little attention, but it poses a number of methodological issues. In this article we approach their analysis using a mixture model. The mixing proportions are specified through an age-dependent branching process that models the temporal organization of the cell population. Because the CFSE molecules are partitioned between daughter cells when their mother divides, the observations generated by this assay are dependent. The data structure can be compared with that of a partially observed random-effects model where the clusters cannot be identified. In this context, we propose three estimators. We prove their consistency and asymptotic normality, investigate their finite-sample properties in simulation studies, and contrast their relative merits for the analysis of CFSE-labeling data. We use the proposed methods to analyze the proliferation in vitro of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. In particular, we compare their activation and proliferation rates, and also investigate the effect of two stimuli that activate resting lymphocytes: the nonspecific mitogen phytohemaglutanin (PHA) and ligation of both the T-cell receptor CD3 and the costimulatory receptor CD28 cell surface proteins with monoclonal antibodies.},

We show that, in a wide range of doses, EdU and BrdU label similar numbers of cells in the dentate gyrus shortly after administration. Furthermore, whereas the administration of EdU does not affect the division and survival of neural progenitor within 48 h after injection, it does affect cell survival, as evaluated 6 weeks later. We also show that a single injection of various doses of EdU on the first postnatal day does not lead to noticeable changes in a panel of morphometric criteria within the first week; however, higher doses of EdU adversely affect the subsequent somatic maturation and brain growth of the mouse pups. Our results indicate the potential caveats in labeling the replicating DNA using thymidine analogs and suggest guidelines for applying this approach.},

Integrating the resulting multimodal single-cell datasets is a new bioinformatics challenge. Equally important, it is a new experimental design challenge for the bench scientist, who is not only choosing from a myriad of techniques for each data modality but also faces new challenges in experimental design. The ultimate goal is to design, execute, and analyze multimodal single-cell experiments that are more than just descriptive but enable the learning of new causal and mechanistic biology. This objective requires strict consideration of the goals behind the analysis, which might range from mapping the heterogeneity of a cellular population to assembling system-wide causal networks that can further our understanding of cellular functions and eventually lead to models of tissues and organs. We review steps and challenges toward this goal. Single-cell transcriptomics is now a mature technology, and methods to measure proteins, lipids, small-molecule metabolites, and other molecular phenotypes at the single-cell level are rapidly developing. Integrating these single-cell readouts so that each cell has measurements of multiple types of data, e.g., transcriptomes, proteomes, and metabolomes, is expected to allow identification of highly specific cellular subpopulations and to provide the basis for inferring causal biological mechanisms.},

Dye-NHS modification of streptavidin severely damaged ligand binding, necessitating development of a new streptavidin-retaining ultrastable binding after labeling. Exploring the ideal level of dye modification, we engineered a panel bearing 1\textendash 6 amines per subunit: ``amine landscaping.'' Surprisingly, brightness increased as amine number decreased, revealing extensive quenching following conventional labeling. We ultimately selected Flavidin (fluorophore-friendly streptavidin), combining ultrastable ligand binding with increased brightness after conjugation. Flavidin enhanced fluorescent imaging, allowing more sensitive and specific cell labeling in tissues. Flavidin should have wide application in molecular detection, providing a general insight into how to optimize simultaneously the behavior of the biomolecule and the chemical probe.},

This substrate is based on the fluorescence quenching of fluorescein held in proximity to rhodamine by a single ribonucleotide embedded within a series of deoxynucleotides. When the substrate is cleaved, the fluorescence of fluorescein is manifested. The optimal substrate is a tetranucleotide with a 5',6-carboxyfluorescein label (6-FAM) and a 3',6-carboxy-tetramethylrhodamine (6-TAMRA) label: 6-FAM-dArUdAdA-6-TAMRA. The fluorescence of this substrate increases 180-fold upon cleavage. Bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A) cleaves this substrate with a k (cat)/ K (m)of 3.6 x 10(7)M(-1)s(-1). Human angiogenin, which is a homolog of RNase A that promotes neovascularization, cleaves this substrate with a k (cat)/ K (m)of 3. 3 x 10(2)M(-1)s(-1). This value is {$>$}10-fold larger than that for other known substrates of angio-genin. With these attributes, 6-FAM-dArUdAdA-6-TAMRA is the most sensitive known substrate for detecting ribo-nucleolytic activity. This high sensitivity enables a simple protocol for the rapid determination of the inhibition constant ( K (i)) for competitive inhibitors such as uridine 3'-phosphate and adenosine 5'-diphos-phate.},

Here, we review recent progress on uncovering the cellular and molecular principles of human brain organogenesis in~vivo as well as using organoids and assembloids in~vitro to model features of human evolution and disease.},

As capacity and accuracy of the experimental techniques grew, the emerging algorithm developments revealed increasingly complex facets of the underlying biology, from cell type composition to gene regulation to developmental dynamics. At the same time, rapid growth has forced continuous reevaluation of the underlying statistical models, experimental aims, and sheer volumes of data processing that are handled by these computational tools. Here, I review key computational steps of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, examine assumptions made by different approaches, and highlight successes, remaining ambiguities, and limitations that are important to keep in mind as scRNA-seq becomes a mainstream technique for studying biology.},

  abstract = {The conjoining of dynamical systems and deep learning has become a topic of great interest. In particular, neural differential equations (NDEs) demonstrate that neural networks and differential equation are two sides of the same coin. Traditional parameterised differential equations are a special case. Many popular neural network architectures, such as residual networks and recurrent networks, are discretisations. NDEs are suitable for tackling generative problems, dynamical systems, and time series (particularly in physics, finance, ...) and are thus of interest to both modern machine learning and traditional mathematical modelling. NDEs offer high-capacity function approximation, strong priors on model space, the ability to handle irregular data, memory efficiency, and a wealth of available theory on both sides. This doctoral thesis provides an in-depth survey of the field. Topics include: neural ordinary differential equations (e.g. for hybrid neural/mechanistic modelling of physical systems); neural controlled differential equations (e.g. for learning functions of irregular time series); and neural stochastic differential equations (e.g. to produce generative models capable of representing complex stochastic dynamics, or sampling from complex high-dimensional distributions). Further topics include: numerical methods for NDEs (e.g. reversible differential equations solvers, backpropagation through differential equations, Brownian reconstruction); symbolic regression for dynamical systems (e.g. via regularised evolution); and deep implicit models (e.g. deep equilibrium models, differentiable optimisation). We anticipate this thesis will be of interest to anyone interested in the marriage of deep learning with dynamical systems, and hope it will provide a useful reference for the current state of the art.},

  abstract = {Variability between human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) lines remains a challenge and opportunity in biomedicine. We identify differences in the spontaneous self-organization of individual hPSC lines during self-renewal that lie along a fundamental axis of in vivo development. Distinct stable and dynamic transcriptional elements were revealed by decomposition of RNA-seq data in pluripotency and early lineage emergence. Stable differences within pluripotency predicted regional bias in the dynamics of neural differentiation that were also observed in large collections of hPSC lines. Using replicate human induced PSC (hiPSC) lines and paired adult tissue, we demonstrate that cells from individual humans expressed unique transcriptional signatures that were maintained throughout life. In addition, replicate hiPSC lines from one donor showed divergent expression phenotypes driven by distinct chromatin states. These stable transcriptional states are under both genetic and epigenetic control and predict bias in subsequent forebrain and hindbrain neural trajectories. These results define mechanisms controlling transcription in pluripotency to first establish human neural diversity.

Here, we describe a simple and cost-effective method for normalizing transcript counts and subtracting technical variability that improves differential expression analysis in scRNA-seq. The method affixes a ladder of synthetic single-stranded DNA oligos to each cell that appears in its RNA-seq library. With improved normalization we explore chemical perturbations with broad or highly specific effects on gene regulation, including RNA pol II elongation, histone deacetylation, and activation of the glucocorticoid receptor. Our methods reveal that inhibiting histone deacetylation prevents cells from executing their canonical program of changes following glucocorticoid stimulation.},

Results are reported for the hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenoxymethyl uridine 3{${'}$}-phosphate, which releases the chromophoric p-nitrophenolate on cleavage of the P\textendash OCH2OAr bond. In the case of catalysis by imidazole, a bell-shaped dependence on the buffer ratio is explained in terms of a solvent effect on the background, hydroxide-catalysed reaction.

We show that SABER amplified RNA and DNA FISH signals (5- to 450-fold) in fixed cells and tissues. We also applied 17 orthogonal amplifiers against chromosomal targets simultaneously and detected mRNAs with high efficiency. We then used 10-plex SABER-FISH to identify in vivo introduced enhancers with cell-type-specific activity in the mouse retina. SABER represents a simple and versatile molecular toolkit for rapid and cost-effective multiplexed imaging of nucleic acid targets.},

The use of oligonucleotide-labelled antibodies for targeted proteomics addresses the shortcomings of the scRNA-seq-only based approach by improving detection of low expressing targets. However, optimisation of large antibody panels is challenging and depends on the availability of co-functioning oligonucleotide-labelled antibodies. Main Methods and Results We present here a simple adjustable oligonucleotide-antibody conjugation method which enables a desired level of oligo-conjugation per antibody. The mean labelling in the produced antibody batches varied from 1 to 6 oligos per antibody. In the scRNA-seq multimodal experiment, the highest sensitivity was seen with moderate antibody labelling as the high activation and/or labelling was detrimental to antibody performance. The conjugates were also tested for compatibility with the fixation and freeze storage protocols. The oligo-antibody signal was stable in fixed cells indicating the feasibility of a stain, fix, store, and analyse later type of workflow for multimodal scRNA-seq. Conclusions and Implications Optimised oligo-labelling will improve detection of weak protein targets in scRNA-seq multimodal experiments and reduce sequencing costs due to a more balanced amplification of different antibody signals in CITE-seq libraries. Furthermore, the use of a pre-stain, fix, run later protocol will allow for flexibility, facilitate sample pooling, and ease logistics in scRNA-seq multimodal experiments.},

  abstract = {Recently, a novel DNA replication precursor analogue called 5-ethynyl-2{${'}$}-deoxyuridine (EdU) has been widely used to monitor DNA synthesis as an alternative to bromodeoxyuridine. Use of EdU benefits from simplicity and reproducibility and the simple chemical detection systems allows excellent preservation of nuclear structure. However, the alkyne moiety is highly reactive, raising the possibility that incorporation might compromise genome stability. To assess the extent of possible DNA damage, we have analysed the effect of EdU incorporation into DNA during short- and long-term cell culture using a variety of cell lines. We show that EdU incorporation has no measurable impact on the rate of elongation of replication forks during synthesis. However, using different cell lines we find that during long-term cell culture variable responses to EdU incorporation are seen, which range from delayed cell cycle progression to complete cell cycle arrest. The most profound phenotypes were seen in mouse embryonic stem cells, which following incorporation of EdU accumulated in the G2/M-phase of the cell cycle before undergoing apoptosis. In long-term cell culture, EdU incorporation also triggered a DNA damage response in all cell types analysed. Our study shows that while EdU is extremely useful to tag sites of on-going replication, for long-term studies (i.e. beyond the cell cycle in which labelling is performed), a careful analysis of cell cycle perturbations must be performed in order to ensure that any conclusions made after EdU treatment are not a direct consequence of EdU-dependent activation of cell stress responses.},

No change in membrane permeability was found at concentrations of 0.15~mM or lower during an experimental period of 30 to 60~min. Permeability of the cell membrane to the otherwise impermeable, highly charged hydrophilic molecule ferrocyanide was seen starting at concentrations of TX100 of about 0.17~mM. This concentration level of TX100 did not affect cell viability. Based on a simulation model, the membrane permeability for ferrocyanide molecules passing though the live cell membrane was 6.5~{$\pm~$}2.0~\texttimes ~10-6~m/s. Cells underwent irreversible permeabilization of the membrane and structural collapse when the TX100 concentration reached the critical micelle concentration (CMC), in the range of 0.19 to 0.20~mM. The impermeability of ferrocyanide molecules in the absence of surfactant was also used to determine the height and diameter of a single living cell with the aid of the approach curve and probe scan methods in SECM.}

  abstract = {A hallmark of neurogenesis in the vertebrate brain is the apical?basal nuclear oscillation in polarized neural progenitor cells. Known as interkinetic nuclear migration (INM), these movements are synchronized with the cell cycle such that nuclei move basally during G1-phase and apically during G2-phase. However, it is unknown how the direction of movement and the cell cycle are tightly coupled. Here, we show that INM proceeds through the cell cycle-dependent linkage of cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms. During S to G2 progression, the microtubule-associated protein Tpx2 redistributes from the nucleus to the apical process, and promotes nuclear migration during G2-phase by altering microtubule organization. Thus, Tpx2 links cell-cycle progression and autonomous apical nuclear migration. In contrast, in vivo observations of implanted microbeads, acute S-phase arrest of surrounding cells and computational modelling suggest that the basal migration of G1-phase nuclei depends on a displacement effect by G2-phase nuclei migrating apically. Our model for INM explains how the dynamics of neural progenitors harmonize their extensive proliferation with the epithelial architecture in the developing brain.},

The commonplace nature of these sounds (often referred to as ``trigger sounds'') makes misophonia a devastating disorder for sufferers and their families, and yet nothing is known about the underlying mechanism. Using functional and structural MRI coupled with physiological measurements, we demonstrate that misophonic subjects show specific trigger-sound-related responses in brain and body. Specifically, fMRI showed that in misophonic subjects, trigger sounds elicit greatly exaggerated blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses in the anterior insular cortex (AIC), a core hub of the~``salience network'' that is critical for perception of interoceptive signals and emotion processing. Trigger sounds in misophonics were associated with abnormal functional connectivity between AIC~and a network of regions responsible for the processing and regulation of emotions, including ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), posteromedial cortex (PMC), hippocampus, and amygdala. Trigger sounds elicited heightened heart rate (HR) and galvanic skin response (GSR) in misophonic subjects, which were mediated by AIC activity. Questionnaire analysis showed that misophonic subjects perceived their bodies differently: they scored higher on interoceptive sensibility than controls, consistent with abnormal functioning of AIC. Finally, brain structural measurements implied greater myelination within vmPFC in misophonic individuals.

  abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of neural network parameters during training is one of the key challenges in building a theoretical foundation for deep learning. A central obstacle is that the motion of a network in high-dimensional parameter space undergoes discrete finite steps along complex stochastic gradients derived from real-world datasets. We circumvent this obstacle through a unifying theoretical framework based on intrinsic symmetries embedded in a network's architecture that are present for any dataset. We show that any such symmetry imposes stringent geometric constraints on gradients and Hessians, leading to an associated conservation law in the continuous-time limit of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), akin to Noether's theorem in physics. We further show that finite learning rates used in practice can actually break these symmetry induced conservation laws. We apply tools from finite difference methods to derive modified gradient flow, a differential equation that better approximates the numerical trajectory taken by SGD at finite learning rates. We combine modified gradient flow with our framework of symmetries to derive exact integral expressions for the dynamics of certain parameter combinations. We empirically validate our analytic expressions for learning dynamics on VGG-16 trained on Tiny ImageNet. Overall, by exploiting symmetry, our work demonstrates that we can analytically describe the learning dynamics of various parameter combinations at finite learning rates and batch sizes for state of the art architectures trained on any dataset.},

Previous studies have explored development in specific brain regions1\textendash 8, the whole adult brain9 and even entire embryos10. Here we report a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the embryonic mouse brain between gastrulation and birth. We identified almost eight hundred cellular states that describe a developmental program for the functional elements of the brain and its enclosing membranes, including the early neuroepithelium, region-specific secondary organizers, and both neurogenic and gliogenic progenitors. We also used in situ mRNA sequencing to map the spatial expression patterns of key developmental genes. Integrating the in situ data with our single-cell clusters revealed the precise spatial organization of neural progenitors during the patterning of the nervous system.},

Moreover, models were proposed for mammalian embryonic, neural and hematopoietic stem cells whereby lengthening of G1 is a cause, rather than a consequence, of differentiation. These models are based on the concept that time, i.e., G1 length, may be a limiting factor for cell fate change to occur because differentiation factors require time in order to trigger a physiological response. Despite the many correlative studies, this hypothesis proved difficult to demonstrate because most trophic, signaling or transcription factors involved in stem cell differentiation may concurrently, but independently, also have an effect on cell cycle progression, which calls for a thorough review on the differentiation role of genes whose best characterized and long established function is exclusively to control G1. For this reason, we here focus our attention on the effects that the core molecular machinery controlling G1 progression, i.e., the G1-specific cyclin dependent kinase (cdk)/cyclin complexes, have on stem cell differentiation. In particular, we will discuss the effects of G1-cdks/cyclins on differentiation of embryonic, neural and hematopoietic stem cells during development and adulthood, for which a role of G1 length has been proposed.},

Our approach combines the robustness of trajectory inference with directional information from RNA velocity, taking into account the gradual and stochastic nature of cellular fate decisions, as well as uncertainty in velocity vectors. On pancreas development data, CellRank automatically detects initial, intermediate and terminal populations, predicts fate potentials and visualizes continuous gene expression trends along individual lineages. Applied to lineage-traced cellular reprogramming data, predicted fate probabilities correctly recover reprogramming outcomes. CellRank also predicts a new dedifferentiation trajectory during postinjury lung regeneration, including previously unknown intermediate cell states, which we confirm experimentally.},

  abstract = {Detergents are indispensable in the isolation of integral membrane proteins from biological membranes to study their intrinsic structural and functional properties. Solubilization involves a number of intermediary states that can be studied by a variety of physicochemical and kinetic methods; it usually starts by destabilization of the lipid component of the membranes, a process that is accompanied by a transition of detergent binding by the membrane from a noncooperative to a cooperative interaction already below the critical micellar concentration (CMC). This leads to the formation of membrane fragments of proteins and lipids with detergent-shielded edges. In the final stage of solubilization membrane proteins are present as protomers, with the membrane inserted sectors covered by detergent. We consider in detail the nature of this interaction and conclude that in general binding as a monolayer ring, rather than as a micelle, is the most probable mechanism. This mode of interaction is supported by neutron diffraction investigations on the disposition of detergent in 3-D crystals of membrane proteins. Finally, we briefly discuss the use of techniques such as analytical ultracentrifugation, size exclusion chromatography, and mass spectrometry relevant for the structural investigation of detergent solubilized membrane proteins.},

Most synthetic schemes to generate these hybrid molecules require expensive reagents, significant quantities of input antibody, and multi-step purification routes, thus limiting widespread application. Here we report a facile and robust conjugation strategy that involves ``plug-and-play'' antibody conjugation with succinimidyl-functionalized oligonucleotides, which are high-yielding and compatible for use directly after buffer exchange. The succinimidyl-linked oligonucleotides are synthesized with 5'-amine-modified oligonucleotides and disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS), both of which are inexpensive and commercially available. Direct incubation of the resulting stable succinimidyl-oligonucleotide conjugates with commercial antibodies yields conjugates ready for use after benchtop buffer exchange. Here we demonstrate that the resulting oligonucleotide-antibody and oligonucleotide-streptavidin conjugates retain potent and specific binding in activity-dependent proximity ligation imaging, and proximity ligation-mediated qPCR detection of endogenous proteins in native cellular contexts down to picogram levels of whole proteome. This DSS conjugation strategy should be widely applicable in the synthesis of protein-oligonucleotide conjugates., A facile and robust antibody-oligonucleotide conjugation strategy based on the homobifunctional linker disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) is described, which involves native antibody and amine-modified oligonucleotides.

Although EdU is employed as a replicational marker more frequently than EdC, its cytotoxicity is commonly much higher than the toxicity of EdC. To reveal the reason of the lower cytotoxicity of EdC, we performed a DNA analysis of five EdC-treated human cell lines. Surprisingly, not a single one of the tested cell lines contained a detectable amount of EdC in their DNA. Instead, the DNA of all the cell lines contained EdU. The content of incorporated EdU differed in particular cells and EdC-related cytotoxicity was directly proportional to the content of EdU. The results of experiments with the targeted inhibition of the cytidine deaminase (CDD) and dCMP deaminase activities indicated that the dominant role in the conversion pathway of EdC to EdUTP is played by CDD in HeLa cells. Our results also showed that the deamination itself was not able to effectively prevent the conversion of EdC to EdCTP, the conversion of EdC to EdCTP occurs with much lesser effectivity than the conversion of EdU to EdUTP and the EdCTP is not effectively recognized by the replication complex as a substrate for the synthesis of nuclear DNA.},

EdU incorporation resulted in abnormalities of the cell cycle including the slowdown of the S phase and a decrease in DNA synthesis. The slowdown but not the cessation of the first cell division after EdU administration was observed in all of the tested cell lines. In HeLa cells, a 10 {$\mu$}M EdU concentration led to the cell death in the 100\% of cells probably due to the activation of an intra S phase checkpoint in the subsequent S phase. Our data also indicates that this EdU concentration induces interstrand DNA crosslinks in HeLa cells. We suppose that these crosslinks are the primary DNA damage resulting in cell death. According to our results, the EdU-mediated toxicity is further increased by the inhibition of thymidylate synthase by EdU itself at its higher concentrations.},

In addition, quantifying the rate enhancements that can be produced exclusively by this common cleavage mechanism is needed to fully interpret the mechanisms employed by ribonucleases and by RNA-cleaving ribozymes. Chimeric DNA/RNA oligonucleotides were used to examine the rates of hydroxide-dependent degradation of RNA phosphodiesters under reaction conditions that simulate those of biological systems. Under neutral or alkaline pH conditions, the dominant pathway for RNA degradation is an internal phosphoester transfer reaction that is promoted by specific base catalysis. As expected, increasing the concentration of hydroxide ion, increasing the concentration of divalent magnesium, or raising the temperature accelerates strand scission. In most instances, the identities of the nucleotide bases that flank the target RNA linkage have a negligible effect on the pKa of the nucleophilic 2`-hydroxyl group, and only have a minor effect on the maximum rate constant for the transesterification reaction. Under representative physiological conditions, specific base catalysis of RNA cleavage generates a maximum rate enhancement of {$\sim$}100\,000-fold over the background rate of RNA transesterification. The kinetic parameters reported herein provide theoretical limits for the stability of RNA polymers and for the proficiency of RNA-cleaving enzymes and enzyme mimics that exclusively employ a mechanism of general base catalysis.}

To realize this potential, we developed MultiVelo, a differential equation model of gene expression that extends the RNA velocity framework to incorporate epigenomic data. MultiVelo uses a probabilistic latent variable model to estimate the switch time and rate parameters of chromatin accessibility and gene expression and improves the accuracy of cell fate prediction compared to velocity estimates from RNA only. Application to multi-omic single-cell datasets from brain, skin and blood cells reveals two distinct classes of genes distinguished by whether chromatin closes before or after transcription ceases. We also find four types of cell states: two states in which epigenome and transcriptome are coupled and two distinct decoupled states. Finally, we identify time lags between transcription factor expression and binding site accessibility and between disease-associated SNP accessibility and expression of the linked genes.

  abstract = {Thousands of intracellular proteins are post-translationally modified with O-GlcNAc, and O-GlcNAcylation impacts the function of modified proteins and mediates diverse biological processes. However, the ubiquity of this important glycosylation makes it highly challenging to probe the O-GlcNAcylation state of a specific protein at the cellular level. Herein, we report the development of a FLIM\textendash FRET-based strategy, which exploits the spatial proximity of the O-GlcNAc moiety and the attaching protein, for protein-specific imaging of O-GlcNAcylation in single cells. We demonstrated this strategy by imaging the O-GlcNAcylation state of tau and {$\beta$}-catenin inside the cells. Furthermore, the changes in tau O-GlcNAcylation were monitored when the overall cellular O-GlcNAc was pharmacologically altered by using the OGT and OGA inhibitors. We envision that the FLIM\textendash FRET strategy will be broadly applicable to probe the O-GlcNAcylation state of various proteins in the cells.},

With this early success, the power of generative models is now being increasingly leveraged in molecular biology, with applications ranging from designing new molecules with properties of interest to identifying deleterious mutations in our genomes and to dissecting transcriptional variability between single cells. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the technical notions behind generative models and their implementation with deep learning techniques. We then describe several different ways in which these models can be utilized in practice, using several recent applications in molecular biology as examples., This Review provides an introduction into~deep generative models and their implementation with deep learning techniques.

  abstract = {Progenitor cells play fundamental roles in preserving optimal organismal functions under normal, aging, and disease conditions. However, progenitor cells are incompletely characterized, especially in the brain, partly because conventional methods are restricted by inadequate throughput and resolution for deciphering cell-type-specific proliferation and differentiation dynamics in vivo. Here, we developed TrackerSci, a new technique that combines in vivo labeling of newborn cells with single-cell combinatorial indexing to profile the single-cell chromatin landscape and transcriptome of rare progenitor cells and track cellular differentiation trajectories in vivo. We applied TrackerSci to analyze the epigenetic and gene expression dynamics of newborn cells across entire mouse brains spanning three age stages and in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Leveraging the dataset, we identified diverse progenitor cell types less-characterized in conventional single cell analysis, and recovered their unique epigenetic signatures. We further quantified the cell-type-specific proliferation and differentiation potentials of progenitor cells, and identified the molecular programs underlying their aging-associated changes (e.g., reduced neurogenesis/oligodendrogenesis). Finally, we expanded our analysis to study progenitor cells in the aged human brain through profiling {$\sim$}800,000 single-cell transcriptomes across five anatomical regions from six aged human brains. We further explored the transcriptome signatures that are shared or divergent between human and mouse oligodendrogenesis, as well as the region-specific down-regulation of oligodendrogenesis in the human cerebellum. Together, the data provide an in-depth view of rare progenitor cells in mammalian brains. We anticipate TrackerSci will be broadly applicable to characterize cell-type-specific temporal dynamics in diverse systems.},

Here, we report a method for spatially resolved epigenomic profiling of single cells using in situ tagmentation and transcription followed by multiplexed imaging. We demonstrated the ability to profile histone modifications marking active promoters, putative enhancers, and silent promoters in individual cells, and generated high-resolution spatial atlas of hundreds of active promoters and putative enhancers in embryonic and adult mouse brains. Our results suggested putative promoter-enhancer pairs and enhancer hubs regulating developmentally important genes. We envision this approach will be generally applicable to spatial profiling of epigenetic modifications and DNA-binding proteins, advancing our understanding of how gene expression is spatiotemporally regulated by the epigenome.},

Here we present photoselective sequencing, a new method for genomic and epigenomic profiling within morphologically distinct regions. Starting with an intact biological specimen, photoselective sequencing uses targeted illumination to selectively unblock a photocaged fragment library, restricting the sequencing-based readout to microscopically identified spatial regions. We validate photoselective sequencing by measuring the chromatin accessibility profiles of fluorescently labeled cell types within the mouse brain and comparing with published data. Furthermore, by combining photoselective sequencing with a computational strategy for decomposing bulk accessibility profiles, we find that the oligodendrocyte-lineage-cell population is relatively enriched for oligodendrocyte-progenitor cells in the cortex versus the corpus callosum. Finally, we leverage photoselective sequencing at the subcellular scale to identify features of chromatin that are correlated with positioning at the nuclear periphery. These results collectively demonstrate that photoselective sequencing is a flexible and generalizable platform for exploring the interplay of spatial structures with genomic and epigenomic properties.},

Synthetic mammalian quorum-sensing circuits could provide insight into principles of population control and extend cell therapies. However, a key challenge is reducing their inherent sensitivity to ``cheater'' mutations that evade control. Here, we repurposed the plant hormone auxin to enable orthogonal mammalian cell-cell communication and quorum sensing. We designed a paradoxical population control circuit, termed ``Paradaux,'' in which auxin stimulates and inhibits net cell growth at different concentrations. This circuit limited population size over extended timescales of up to 42~days of continuous culture. By contrast, when operating in a non-paradoxical regime, population control became more susceptible to mutational escape. These results establish auxin as a versatile ``private'' communication system and demonstrate that paradoxical circuit architectures can provide robust population control.},

A key benefit of formamide is better preservation of morphology due to a lower incubation temperature. However, in fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), against unique DNA targets in tissue sections, an overnight hybridization is required to obtain sufficient signal intensity. Here, we identified alternative solvents and developed a new hybridization buffer that reduces the required hybridization time to one hour (IQFISH method). Remarkably, denaturation and blocking against repetitive DNA sequences to prevent non-specific binding is not required. Furthermore, the new hybridization buffer is less hazardous than formamide containing buffers. The results demonstrate a significant increased hybridization rate at a lowered denaturation and hybridization temperature for both DNA and PNA (peptide nucleic acid) probes. We anticipate that these formamide substituting solvents will become the foundation for changes in the understanding and performance of denaturation and hybridization of nucleic acids. For example, the process time for tissue-based ISH for gene aberration tests in cancer diagnostics can be reduced from days to a few hours. Furthermore, the understanding of the interactions and duplex formation of nucleic acid strands may benefit from the properties of these solvents.},

While many genes regulating embryonic development have been identified, the underlying CRE dynamics controlling their expression remain largely uncharacterized. To address this, we produced a multimodal resource and genomic regulatory map for the zebrafish community, which integrates single-cell combinatorial indexing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (sci-ATAC-seq) with bulk histone PTMs and Hi-C data to achieve a genome-wide classification of the regulatory architecture determining transcriptional activity in the 24-h post-fertilization (hpf) embryo. We characterized the genome-wide chromatin architecture at bulk and single-cell resolution, applying sciATAC-seq on whole 24-hpf stage zebrafish embryos, generating accessibility profiles for \$23,000 single nuclei. We developed a genome segmentation method, ScregSeg (single-cell regulatory landscape segmentation), for defining regulatory programs, and candidate CREs, specific to one or more cell types. We integrated the ScregSeg output with bulk measurements for histone post-translational modifications and 3D genome organization and identified new regulatory principles between chromatin modalities prevalent during zebrafish development. Sci-ATAC-seq profiling of npas4l/cloche mutant embryos identified novel cellular roles for this hematovascular transcriptional master regulator and suggests an intricate mechanism regulating its expression. Our work defines regulatory architecture and principles in the zebrafish embryo and establishes a resource of cell-type-specific genome-wide regulatory annotations and candidate CREs, providing a valuable open resource for genomics, developmental, molecular, and computational biology.},

Overexpression of P19 cell-extrinsically inhibited neuronal migration and acted as chemoattractant of microglial cells. Interestingly, effects on neuronal migration were found to result directly from P19 secretion by neural progenitors triggering microglia accumulation within the P19 targeted area.

During later corticogenesis, IP laminar fates are progressively limited to upper layers. We examined the role of Tbr2, an IP-specific transcription factor, in laminar fate regulation using \emph{Tbr2} conditional mutant mice. Upon \emph{Tbr2} inactivation, fewer neurons were produced by immediate differentiation and laminar fates were shifted upward. Genesis of subventricular mitoses was, however, not reduced in the context of a \emph{Tbr2}-null cortex. Instead, neuronal and laminar differentiation were disrupted and delayed.

Although microcephaly has both a genetic and environmental etiology, the mechanisms by which dysregulation of mitosis causes microcephaly are poorly understood. We previously discovered that prolonged mitosis of mouse neural progenitors, either ex vivo or in vitro, directly alters progeny cell fate, \-resulting in precocious differentiation and apoptosis. This raises questions as to whether prolonged progenitor mitosis affects cell fate and neurogenesis in vivo, and what are the underlying mechanisms? Methods/Results: Towards addressing these knowledge gaps, we developed an in vivo model of mitotic delay. This uses pharmacological inhibition to acutely and reversibly prolong mitosis during cortical development, and fluorescent dyes to label direct progeny. Using this model, we discovered that a causal relationship between mitotic delay of neural progenitors and altered progeny cell fate is evident in vivo. Using transcriptome analyses to investigate the state of delayed cells and their progeny, we uncovered potential molecular mechanisms by which prolonged mitosis induces altered cell fates, including DNA damage and p53 signaling. We then extended our studies to human neural progenitors, demonstrating that lengthened mitosis duration also directly alters neuronal cell fate. Conclusions: This study establishes a valuable new experimental paradigm towards understanding mechanisms whereby lengthened mitosis duration may explain some cases of microcephaly.}

However, background\textemdash from off-target binding of FISH probes and cellular autofluorescence\textemdash can become limiting in a number of important applications, such as increasing the degree of multiplexing, imaging shorter RNAs, and imaging tissue samples. Here, we developed a sample clearing approach for FISH measurements. We identified off-target binding of FISH probes to cellular components other than RNA, such as proteins, as a major source of background. To remove this source of background, we embedded samples in polyacrylamide, anchored RNAs to this polyacrylamide matrix, and cleared cellular proteins and lipids, which are also sources of autofluorescence. To demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, we measured the copy number of 130 RNA species in cleared samples using multiplexed error-robust FISH (MERFISH). We observed a reduction both in the background because of off-target probe binding and in the cellular autofluorescence without detectable loss in RNA. This process led to an improved detection efficiency and detection limit of MERFISH, and an increased measurement throughput via extension of MERFISH into four color channels. We further demonstrated MERFISH measurements of complex tissue samples from the mouse brain using this matrix-imprinting and -clearing approach. We envision that this method will improve the performance of a wide range of in situ hybridization-based techniques in both cell culture and tissues.}

These image-based approaches naturally preserve the native spatial context of RNAs within a cell and the organization of cells within tissue, which are important for addressing many biological questions. However, the throughput of these image-based approaches is relatively low. Here we report advances that lead to a drastic increase in the measurement throughput of multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), an image-based approach to single-cell transcriptomics. In MERFISH, RNAs are identified via a combinatorial labeling approach that encodes RNA species with error-robust barcodes followed by sequential rounds of single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) to read out these barcodes. Here we increase the throughput of MERFISH by two orders of magnitude through a combination of improvements, including using chemical cleavage instead of photobleaching to remove fluorescent signals between consecutive rounds of smFISH imaging, increasing the imaging field of view, and using multicolor imaging. With these improvements, we performed RNA profiling in more than 100,000 human cells, with as many as 40,000 cells measured in a single 18-h measurement. This throughput should substantially extend the range of biological questions that can be addressed by MERFISH.}

  abstract = {In the developing cerebral cortex, how progenitors that seemingly display limited diversity end up producing a vast array of neurons remains a puzzling question. The prevailing model suggests that temporal maturation of progenitors is a key driver in the diversification of the neuronal output. However, temporal constraints are unlikely to account for all diversity, especially in the ventral and lateral pallium where neuronal types significantly differ from their dorsal neocortical counterparts born at the same time. In this study, we implemented single-cell RNAseq to sample the diversity of progenitors and neurons along the dorso-ventral axis of the early developing pallium. We first identified neuronal types, mapped them on the tissue and determined their origin through genetic tracing. We characterised progenitor diversity and disentangled the gene modules underlying temporal versus spatial regulations of neuronal specification. Finally, we reconstructed the developmental trajectories followed by ventral and dorsal pallial neurons to identify lineage-specific gene waves. Our data suggest a model by which discrete neuronal fate acquisition from a continuous gradient of progenitors results from the superimposition of spatial information and temporal maturation.}

  abstract = {Multimodal single-cell profiling methods that measure protein expression with oligo-conjugated antibodies hold promise for comprehensive dissection of cellular heterogeneity, yet the resulting protein counts have substantial technical noise that can mask biological variations. Here we integrate experiments and computational analyses to reveal two major noise sources and develop a method called ``dsb'' (denoised and scaled by background) to normalize and denoise droplet-based protein expression data. We discover that protein-specific noise originates from unbound antibodies encapsulated during droplet generation; this noise can thus be accurately estimated and corrected by utilizing protein levels in empty droplets. We also find that isotype control antibodies and the background protein population average in each cell exhibit significant correlations across single cells, we thus use their shared variance to correct for cell-to-cell technical noise in each cell. We validate these findings by analyzing the performance of dsb in eight independent datasets spanning multiple technologies, including CITE-seq, ASAP-seq, and TEA-seq. Compared to existing normalization methods, our approach improves downstream analyses by better unmasking biologically meaningful cell populations. Our method is available as an open-source R package that interfaces easily with existing single cell software platforms such as Seurat, Bioconductor, and Scanpy and can be accessed at ``dsb [https://cran.r-project.org/package=dsb]''.},

We develop symmetrical strand sci (`s3'), a uracil-based adapter switching approach that improves the rate of conversion of source DNA into viable sequencing library fragments following tagmentation. We apply this chemistry to assay chromatin accessibility (s3-assay for transposase-accessible chromatin, s3-ATAC) in human cortical and mouse whole-brain tissues, with mouse datasets demonstrating a six- to 13-fold improvement in usable reads per cell compared with other available methods. Application of s3 to single-cell whole-genome sequencing (s3-WGS) and to whole-genome plus chromatin conformation (s3-GCC) yields 148- and 14.8-fold improvements, respectively, in usable reads per cell compared with sci-DNA-sequencing and sci-HiC. We show that s3-WGS and s3-GCC resolve subclonal genomic alterations in patient-derived pancreatic cancer cell lines. We expect that the s3 platform will be compatible with other transposase-based techniques, including sci-MET or CUT\&Tag.},

The spatial organization of cells in tissues can be studied by emerging technologies, including multiplexed imaging and spatial transcriptomics, which can now be combined with ultra-sensitive proteomics.

  abstract = {Although single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is currently the gold standard for the analysis of cell-specific expression profiles, the options for processing, staining, and preserving fresh cells remain very limited. Immediate and correct tissue processing is a critical determinant of scRNA-seq success. One major limitation is the restricted compatibility of fixation approaches, which must not destabilize or alter antibody labeling or RNA content or interfere with cell integrity. An additional limitation is the availability of expensive, high-demand cell-sorting equipment to exclude debris and dead or unwanted cells before proceeding with sample sequencing. The goal of this study was to develop a method that allows cells to be fixed and stored prior to FACS sorting for scRNA-seq without compromising the quality of the results. Finally, the challenge of preserving as many living cells as possible during tissue processing is another crucial issue addressed in this study. Our study focused on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma samples, where the number of live cells is rather limited, as in many other tumor tissues. Harsh tissue dissociation methods and sample preparation for analysis can negatively affect cell viability. Using the murine pancreatic cancer model Pan02, we evaluated the semi-automated mechanical/enzymatic digestion of solid tumors by gentleMACS Dissociator and compared it with mechanical dissociation of the same tissue. Moreover, we investigated a type of cell fixation that is successful in preserving cell RNA integrity yet compatible with FACS and subsequent scRNA-sequencing. Our protocol allows tissue to be dissociated and stained in one day and proceeds to cell sorting and scRNA-seq later, which is a great advantage for processing clinical patient material.},

  abstract = {Background Multiplexing of samples in single-cell RNA-seq studies allows a significant reduction of the experimental costs, straightforward identification of doublets, increased cell throughput, and reduction of sample-specific batch effects. Recently published multiplexing techniques using oligo-conjugated antibodies or -lipids allow barcoding sample-specific cells, a process called ``hashing.'' Results Here, we compare the hashing performance of TotalSeq-A and -C antibodies, custom synthesized lipids and MULTI-seq lipid hashes in four cell lines, both for single-cell RNA-seq and single-nucleus RNA-seq. We also compare TotalSeq-B antibodies with CellPlex reagents (10x Genomics) on human PBMCs and TotalSeq-B with different lipids on primary mouse tissues. Hashing efficiency was evaluated using the intrinsic genetic variation of the cell lines and mouse strains. Antibody hashing was further evaluated on clinical samples using PBMCs from healthy and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, where we demonstrate a more affordable approach for large single-cell sequencing clinical studies, while simultaneously reducing batch effects. Conclusions Benchmarking of different hashing strategies and computational pipelines indicates that correct demultiplexing can be achieved with both lipid- and antibody-hashed human cells and nuclei, with MULTISeqDemux as the preferred demultiplexing function and antibody-based hashing as the most efficient protocol on cells. On nuclei datasets, lipid hashing delivers the best results. Lipid hashing also outperforms antibodies on cells isolated from mouse brain. However, antibodies demonstrate better results on tissues like spleen or lung. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13059-022-02628-8.},

  abstract = {The isolation of nuclei is often the first step in studying processes such as nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling, subcellular localization of proteins, and protein\textendash chromatin or nuclear protein\textendash protein interactions in response to diverse stimuli. Therefore, rapidly obtaining nuclei from cells with relatively high purity and minimal subcellular contamination, protein degradation, or postharvesting modification is highly desirable. Historically, the isolation of nuclei involved a homogenization step followed by centrifugation through high-density glycerol or sucrose. Although clean nuclei with little cytoplasmic contamination can be prepared using this method, it is typically time consuming and can allow protein degradation, protein modification, and leaching of components from the nuclei to occur. We have developed a rapid and simple fractionation method that is based on the selective dissolution of the cytoplasmic membrane (but not the nuclear membrane) using a low concentration of a nonionic detergent and rapid centrifugation steps. Here we describe important considerations when isolating nuclei from cells, introduce our rapid method, and compare this method to a more traditional protocol for isolating nuclei, noting the strengths and limitations of each approach.},

We have previously described an active machine learning algorithm that can iteratively choose small sets of experiments to learn models of multiple effects. We now show that, with no prior knowledge and with liquid handling robotics and automated microscopy under its control, this learner accurately learned the effects of 48 chemical compounds on the subcellular localization of 48 proteins while performing only 29\% of all possible experiments. The results represent the first practical demonstration of the utility of active learning-driven biological experimentation in which the set of possible phenotypes is unknown in advance.},

In spite of the clinical importance, the molecular mechanism for this chromosomal translocation has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we employed 2-color FISH and detected intracellular chromosomal translocations induced by etoposide treatment. Cells such as ataxia-telangiectasia mutated\textendash deficient fibroblasts and U2OS cells, in which the early G2/M checkpoint after treatment with low concentrations of etoposide has been lost, executed mitosis with etoposide-induced DNA double-strand breaks, and 2-color FISH signals located on either side of the MLL gene were segregated in the postmitotic G1 phase. Long-term culture of cells that had executed mitosis under etoposide treatment showed frequent structural abnormalities of chromosome 11. These findings provide convincing evidence for Topo II inhibitor\textendash induced 11q23 translocation. Our study also suggests an important role of the early G2/M checkpoint in preventing fixation of chromosomal abnormalities and reveals environmental and genetic risk factors for the development of chromosome 11 translocations, namely, low concentrations of Topo II inhibitors and dysfunctional early G2/M checkpoint control.},

  abstract = {Commonly used metabolic labels for DNA, including 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) and BrdU, are toxic antimetabolites that cause DNA instability, necrosis, and cell-cycle arrest. In addition to perturbing biological function, these properties can prevent metabolic labeling studies where subsequent tissue survival is needed. To bypass the metabolic pathways responsible for toxicity, while maintaining the ability to be metabolically incorporated into DNA, we synthesized and evaluated a small family of arabinofuranosyl-ethynyluracil derivatives. Among these, (2'S)-2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-5-ethynyluridine (F-ara-EdU) exhibited selective DNA labeling, yet had a minimal impact on genome function in diverse tissue types. Metabolic incorporation of F-ara-EdU into DNA was readily detectable using copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne "click" reactions with fluorescent azides. F-ara-EdU is less toxic than both BrdU and EdU, and it can be detected with greater sensitivity in experiments where long-term cell survival and/or deep-tissue imaging are desired. In contrast to previously reported 2'-arabino modified nucleosides and EdU, F-ara-EdU causes little or no cellular arrest or DNA synthesis inhibition. F-ara-EdU is therefore ideally suited for pulse-chase experiments aimed at "birth dating" DNA in vivo. As a demonstration, Zebrafish embryos were microinjected with F-ara-EdU at the one-cell stage and chased by BrdU at 10~h after fertilization. Following 3~d of development, complex patterns of quiescent/senescent cells containing only F-ara-EdU were observed in larvae along the dorsal side of the notochord and epithelia. Arabinosyl nucleoside derivatives therefore provide unique and effective means to introduce bioorthogonal functional groups into DNA for diverse applications in basic research, biotechnology, and drug discovery.},

As a proof of principle, intracellular staining for TNF{$\alpha$} and IFN{$\gamma$} identified cytomegalovirus (CMV)- and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-reactive TCRs with efficiencies similar to state-of-the-art peptide-MHC multimer methodology. In a separate experiment, regulatory T cells were profiled based on intracellular FOXP3 staining, demonstrating the ability to examine phenotypes based on transcription factors. We further optimized the intracellular staining conditions to use a chemically cleavable primary amine cross-linker compatible with current single-cell sequencing technology. CLInt-Seq for TNF{$\alpha$} and IFN{$\gamma$} performed similarly to isolation with multimer staining for EBV-reactive TCRs.

However, sorting based on intracellular markers requires fixation and permeabilization of samples, and very often the integrity of RNA molecules is compromised during this process. Many attempts have been made to improve the quality of nucleic acids from such samples, but RNA degradation still remains a limiting factor for downstream analyses.

By performing all incubation steps in the presence of a high salt buffer, RNA degradation was avoided and samples with remarkable integrity were obtained.

  abstract = {Must higher level biological processes always be derivable from lower level data and mechanisms, as assumed by the idea that an organism is completely defined by its genome? Or are higher level properties necessarily also causes of lower level behaviour, involving actions and interactions both ways? This article uses modelling of the heart, and its experimental basis, to show that downward causation is necessary and that this form of causation can be represented as the influences of initial and boundary conditions on the solutions of the differential equations used to represent the lower level processes. These insights are then generalized. A priori, there is no privileged level of causation. The relations between this form of `biological relativity' and forms of relativity in physics are discussed. Biological relativity can be seen as an extension of the relativity principle by avoiding the assumption that there is a privileged scale at which biological functions are determined.},

  abstract = {The diverse subtypes of excitatory neurons that populate the neocortex are born from apical progenitors located in the ventricular zone. During corticogenesis, apical progenitors sequentially generate deep-layer neurons followed by superficial-layer neurons directly or via the generation of intermediate progenitors. Whether neurogenic fate progression necessarily implies fate restriction in single progenitor types is unknown. Here we specifically isolated apical progenitors and intermediate progenitors, and fate-mapped their respective neuronal progeny following heterochronic transplantation into younger embryos. We find that apical progenitors are temporally plastic and can re-enter past molecular, electrophysiological and neurogenic states when exposed to an earlier-stage environment by sensing dynamic changes in extracellular Wnt. By contrast, intermediate progenitors are committed progenitors that lack such retrograde fate plasticity. These findings identify a diversity in the temporal plasticity of neocortical progenitors, revealing that some subtypes of~cells can be untethered from their normal temporal progression to re-enter past developmental states.},

Large single DNA molecules undergo reentrant conformational transitions from elongated coil into folded globule and then into elongated coil state, accompanied by the increase of the concentration of ethanol in a low-salt aqueous environment. The second transition from globule into the coil state occurs at around 70\,\% (v/v) ethanol. From circular dichroism (CD) measurements, it is confirmed that the reentrant transition of the higher order structure proceeds together with the transitions of the secondary structure from B to C and, then, from C to A in a cooperative manner. The determined mechanism of the reentrant transition is discussed in relation to the unique characteristics of solutions with higher ethanol content, for which clathrate-like nanostructures of alcohol molecules are generated in the surrounding water.},

  abstract = {The study of early events in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) life cycle can be limited by the relatively low numbers of cells that can be infected synchronously in vitro. Although the efficiency of HIV-1 infection can be substantially improved by centrifugal inoculation (spinoculation or shell vial methods), the underlying mechanism of enhancement has not been defined. To understand spinoculation in greater detail, we have used real-time PCR to quantitate viral particles in suspension, virions that associate with cells, and the ability of those virions to give rise to reverse transcripts. We report that centrifugation of HIV-1IIIBvirions at 1,200 \texttimes{} g for 2 h at 25\textdegree C increases the number of particles that bind to CEM-SS T-cell targets by {$\sim$}40-fold relative to inoculation by simple virus-cell mixing. Following subsequent incubation at 37\textdegree C for 5 h to allow membrane fusion and uncoating to occur, the number of reverse transcripts per target cell was similarly enhanced. Indeed, by culturing spinoculated samples for 24 h, {$\sim$}100\% of the target cells were reproducibly shown to be productively infected, as judged by the expression of p24gag. Because the modestg forces employed in this procedure were found to be capable of sedimenting viral particles and because CD4-specific antibodies were effective at blocking virus binding, we propose that spinoculation works by depositing virions on the surfaces of target cells and that diffusion is the major rate-limiting step for viral adsorption under routine in vitro pulsing conditions. Thus, techniques that accelerate the binding of viruses to target cells not only promise to facilitate the experimental investigation of postentry steps of HIV-1 infection but should also help to enhance the efficacy of virus-based genetic therapies.}

The high pressure to integrate the technology into daily laboratory live requires solid knowledge with respect to potential limitations and precautions to be taken care of before applying it to complex research questions. In the past, we have identified two issues with quality measures neglected by the growing community involving SmartSeq and droplet or micro-well-based scRNASeq methods (1) how to ensure that only single cells are introduced without biasing on light scattering when handling complex cell mixtures and organ preparations or (2) how best to control for (pro-)apoptotic cell contaminations in single-cell sequencing approaches. Sighting of concurrent literature involving single-cell sequencing technologies revealed that these topics are generally neglected or simply approached in silico but not at the bench before generating single-cell data sets. We fear that those important quality aspects are overlooked due to reduced awareness of their importance for guaranteeing the quality of experiments. In this Cytometry rigor issue, we provide experimentally supported guidance on how to circumvent those critical shortcomings in order to promote a better use of the fantastic single-cell sequencing toolbox in biology. \textcopyright{} 2019 The Authors.

Developers of analytical tools need to decide on the intrinsic molecular features of each cell that need to be considered, and how cell shape and morphological features are incorporated into the analysis. Also, optimal ways to compare different tissue samples at various length scales are still being sought.

To this end, both modelling and software frameworks are required to enable modular modelling. While there has been consistent progress in the development of software tools to enhance model reusability, there has been a relative lack of consideration for how underlying biophysical principles can be applied to this space. Bond graphs combine the aspects of both modularity and physics-based modelling. In this paper, we argue that bond graphs are compatible with recent developments in modularity and abstraction in systems biology, and are thus a desirable framework for constructing large-scale models. We use two examples to illustrate the utility of bond graphs in this context: a model of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade to illustrate the reusability of modules and a model of glycolysis to illustrate the ability to modify the model granularity.},

RNA degradation is minimized through stabilization of the CuI in aqueous buffer with acetonitrile as cosolvent and no other ligand; this suggests the general possibility of ?ligandless? click chemistry. With the viability of click chemistry validated on synthetic RNA bearing ?click?-reactive alkynes, the scope of the reaction is extended to in-vitro-transcribed or, indeed, any RNA, as a click-reactive azide is incorporated enzymatically. Once clickable groups are installed on RNA, they can be rapidly click labeled or conjugated together in click ligations, which may be either templated or nontemplated. In click ligations the resultant unnatural triazole-linked RNA backbone is not detrimental to RNA function, thus suggesting a broad applicability of click chemistry in RNA biological studies.},

Fortunately, chemists have bridged this experimental gap through the creation of bioorthogonal reactions. These reactions allow for the incorporation of chemical groups with highly selective reactivity into small molecules or protein modifications without perturbing their biological function, enabling the selective installation of an analysis tag for downstream investigations. The introduction of chemical strategies to parse and enrich subsets of the ``functional'' proteome has empowered mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods to delve more deeply and precisely into the biochemical state of cells and its perturbations by small molecules. In this Primer, we discuss how one of the most versatile bioorthogonal reactions, ``click chemistry'', has been exploited to overcome limitations of biological approaches to enable the selective marking and functional investigation of critical protein-small-molecule interactions and PTMs in native biological environments.},

These mechanisms are governed by the cell-cycle regulators cyclin D1-3 that control differentiation signals such as the TGF-{$\beta$}-Smad2/3 pathway. Conversely, cell-cycle manipulation using a small molecule directs differentiation of hPSCs and provides an approach to generate cell types with a clinical interest.

These pulsing times, allowing labelling for a full S phase of a fraction of cells in asynchronous populations, provide accurate values for the absolute length of S phase. We characterized additional, lower intensity signals that allowed quantification of the absolute durations of G1 and G2 phases., Importantly, using this novel assay data on the lengths of G1, S and G2/M phases are obtained in parallel. Therefore, these parameters can be estimated within a time frame that is shorter than a full cell cycle. This method, which we designate as EdU-Coupled Fluorescence Intensity (E-CFI) analysis, was successfully applied to cell types with distinctive cell cycle features and shows excellent agreement with established methodologies for analysis of cell cycle kinetics.},

  abstract = {The link between cortical precursors G1 duration (TG1) and their mode of division remains a major unresolved issue of potential importance for regulating corticogenesis. Here, we induced a 25\% reduction in TG1 in mouse cortical precursors via forced expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin E1. We found that in utero electroporation-mediated gene transfer transfects a cohort of synchronously cycling precursors, necessitating alternative methods of measuring cell-cycle phases to those classical used. TG1 reduction promotes cell-cycle reentry at the expense of differentiation and increases the self-renewal capacities of Pax6 precursors as well as of Tbr2 basal precursors (BPs). A population level analysis reveals sequential and lineage-specific effects, showing that TG1 reduction: (i) promotes Pax6 self-renewing proliferative divisions before promoting divisions wherein Pax6 precursors generate Tbr2 BPs and (ii) promotes self-renewing proliferative divisions of Tbr2 precursors at the expense of neurogenesis, thus leading to an amplification of the BPs pool in the subventricular zone and the dispersed mitotic compartment of the intermediate zone. These results point to the G1 mode of division relationship as an essential control mechanism of corticogenesis. This is further supported by long-term studies showing that TG1 reduction results in cytoarchitectural modifications including supernumerary supragranular neuron production. Modeling confirms that the TG1-induced changes in neuron production and laminar fate are mediated via the changes in the mode of division. These findings also have implications for understanding the mechanisms that have contributed to brain enlargement and complexity during evolution.},

Genetic mutations disrupting progenitor mitosis frequently impair neurogenesis, however the link between altered mitosis and cell fate remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that prolonged mitosis of radial glial progenitors directly alters neuronal fate specification and progeny viability. Live imaging of progenitors from a neurogenesis mutant, Magoh+/-, reveals mitotic delay significantly correlates with preferential production of neurons instead of progenitors, as well as apoptotic progeny. Independently, two pharmacological approaches reveal a causal relationship between mitotic delay and progeny fate. As mitotic duration increases, progenitors produce substantially more apoptotic or neurogenic progeny. We show apoptosis, but not differentiation, is p53-dependent, demonstrating these are distinct outcomes of mitotic delay. Together our findings reveal prolonged mitosis is sufficient to alter fates of radial glia progeny and define a new paradigm to understand how mitosis perturbations underlie brain size disorders such as microcephaly.,},

With paraformaldehyde/methanol fixation, cell morphology was well preserved and forward and right angle light scatter properties were sufficiently well maintained to permit gating on these parameters. Cell surface marker staining with fluorescent anti-leukocyte antibodies was unaffected by fixation with paraformaldehyde/methanol. Paraformaldehyde effects on the intensity oaf DNA staining with propidium iodide were dependent on paraformaldehyde concentration and Fixation temperature; these effects were least pronounced at low paraformaldehyde concentrations (0.25\% or less), and at temperatures lower than 37\textdegree C. Paraformaldehyde fixation may result in differences in propidium iodide staining of DNA in some diploid cells, which may produce small spurious aneuploid peaks in normal peripheral blood leukocytes. Paraformaldehyde fixation also produces an apparent increase in the DNA index of aneuploid cell populations in comparison with methanol fixation, particularly when the DNA index exceeds 1.5. Occasionally, this paraformaldehyde fixation-induced effect is useful in identifying biologically distinct near-diploid subpopulations in tumors.},

The cell cycle dynamics of stem cells (B1 cells), intermediate progenitors (C cells), and neuroblasts (A cells) in the V-SVZ and the number of times these cells divide remain unknown. Using whole mounts of the walls of the lateral ventricles of adult mice and three cell cycle analysis methods using thymidine analogs, we determined the proliferation dynamics of B1, C, and A cells in vivo. Achaete-scute complex homolog (Ascl)1+ C cells were heterogeneous with a cell cycle length (TC) of 18\textendash 25 h and a long S phase length (TS) of 14\textendash 17 h. After C cells, Doublecortin+ A cells were the second-most common dividing cell type in the V-SVZ and had a TC of 18 h and TS of 9 h. Human glial fibrillary acidic protein (hGFAP)::GFP+ B1 cells had a surprisingly short Tc of 17\textendash 18 h and a TS of 4 h. Progenitor population analysis suggests that following the initial division of B1 cells, C cells divide three times and A cells once, possibly twice. These data provide essential information on the dynamics of adult progenitor cell proliferation in the V-SVZ and how large numbers of new neurons continue to be produced in the adult mammalian brain.}

The third approach is based on the bivariate analysis of DNA content and proliferation-associated proteins. The expression of cyclin D, cyclin E, cyclin A, or cyclin B1 vs DNA content is presented as an example. This approach allows one to distinguish, for example, G0 from G1 cells, identify mitotic cells, or relate expression of other intracellular proteins to the cell cycle position.

Furthermore, we collect networks from multiple experimental single-cell RNA-seq datasets. We develop an evaluation framework called BEELINE. We find that the area under the precision-recall curve and early precision of the algorithms are moderate. The methods are better in recovering interactions in synthetic networks than Boolean models. The algorithms with the best early precision values for Boolean models also perform well on experimental datasets. Techniques that do not require pseudotime-ordered cells are generally more accurate. Based on these results, we present recommendations to end users. BEELINE will aid the development of gene regulatory network inference algorithms.},

Several ``mixed'' ligands were identified that performed well under both types of conditions.

The properties of CFSE make it ideal for such a task, covalently labelling cells with a long-lived fluorescence of high intensity and low variance with minimal cell toxicity. No dye in the last 20years has been capable of replicating CFSE in these respects. However, currently CFSE is limited to following a maximum of 7 cell divisions and is not compatible for use with ubiquitously available fluorescein conjugates or other fluorescent molecules with spectral properties similar to fluorescein, such as EGFP. Here we characterise two new fluorescent dyes for measuring lymphocyte proliferation, Cell Trace Violet (CTV) and Cell Proliferation Dye eFluor 670 (CPD), which have different excitation and emission spectra to CFSE and, consequently, are compatible with fluorescein conjugates. We found that while both CTV and CPD can label cells to a high fluorescence intensity, which is long-lived and has low variability and low toxicity and makes them ideal for long-term tracking of non-dividing lymphocytes in vivo, CTV offers possibly the best available alternative to CFSE in the analysis of cell divisions. We also describe how intercellular dye transfer and cell autofluorescence can affect division resolution with the three different dyes and describe labelling conditions for the three dyes that produce ultra-bright lymphocytes for in vivo tracking studies and allow up to 11 cell divisions to be detected when using CFSE and CTV as the fluorescent dyes.},

Clustering analysis of RNA kinetic parameters across single cells revealed `kinetic gene clusters' whose expression patterns were shaped by multistep kinetic sculpting. Importantly, these kinetic gene clusters are functionally segregated, suggesting that subcellular RNA kinetics are differentially regulated in a cell-state- and cell-type-dependent manner.

However, many miRNA detection methods, such as real-time PCR, obliterate valuable visuospatial information in tissue samples. To enable miRNA visualization in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, we developed multicolor miRNA FISH. As a proof of concept, we used this method to differentiate two skin tumors, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), with overlapping histologic features but distinct cellular origins. Using sequencing-based miRNA profiling and discriminant analysis, we identified the tumor-specific miRNAs miR-205 and miR-375 in BCC and MCC, respectively. We addressed three major shortcomings in miRNA FISH, identifying optimal conditions for miRNA fixation and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) retention using model compounds and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses, enhancing signal amplification and detection by increasing probe-hapten linker lengths, and improving probe specificity using shortened probes with minimal rRNA sequence complementarity. We validated our method on 4 BCC and 12 MCC tumors. Amplified miR-205 and miR-375 signals were normalized against directly detectable reference rRNA signals. Tumors were classified using predefined cutoff values, and all were correctly identified in blinded analysis. Our study establishes a reliable miRNA FISH technique for parallel visualization of differentially expressed miRNAs in FFPE tumor tissues.},

Using a WNT-activating gradient, we generated a neural tissue exhibiting progressive caudalization from forebrain to midbrain to hindbrain, including formation of isthmic organizer characteristics. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed that rostro-caudal organization was already established at 24\,h of differentiation, and that the first markers of a neural-specific transcription program emerged in the rostral cells at 48\,h. The transcriptomic hallmarks of rostro-caudal organization recapitulated gene expression patterns of the early rostro-caudal neural plate in mouse embryos.

While a majority of literature reports mark cell-surface exposed targets, implementing bioorthogonal ligations in the interior of cells constitutes a more challenging task. Owing to limiting factors such as membrane permeability of reagents, fluorescence background due to hydrophobic interactions and off-target covalent binding, and suboptimal balance between reactivity and stability of the designed molecular reporters and probes, these strategies need mindful planning to achieve success.

Halogenated pyrimidines (HPs), such as bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), are a class of TAs that can be detected with antibodies and are commonly used for birthdating individual cells and for assessing the proliferative index of cell populations. It is well established that HPs can act as radiosensitizers when incorporated into DNA chains, but they are generally believed not to impair normal cell function in the absence of secondary stressors. However, we and others have shown that HP incorporation leads to a sustained suppression of cell cycle progression in mammalian cells, resulting in cellular senescence in somatic cells. In addition, we have shown that HP incorporation results in delayed tumor progression in a syngeneic rat model of glioma. Here we examine ethynyldeoxyuridine (EdU), a newly developed and alkylated TA, for its anti-cancer activity, both in vitro and in vivo. We show that EdU, like HPs, leads to a severe reduction in the proliferation rate of normal and transformed cells in vitro. Unlike HPs, however, EdU incorporation also causes DNA damage resulting in the death of a substantial subset of treated cells. When administered over an extended time as a monotherapy to mice bearing subcutaneous xenografts of human glioblastoma multiforme tumors, EdU significantly reduces tumor volume and increases survival without apparent significant toxicity. These results, combined with the fact that EdU readily crosses the blood\textendash brain barrier, support the continued investigation of EdU as a potential therapy for malignant brain tumors.},

  abstract = {In the mammalian neocortex, projection neuron types are sequentially generated by the same pool of neural progenitors. How neuron type specification is related to developmental timing remains unclear. To determine whether temporal gene expression in neural progenitors correlates with neuron type specification, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) analysis of the developing mouse neocortex. We uncovered neuroepithelial cell enriched genes such as Hmga2 and Ccnd1 when compared to radial glial cells (RGCs). RGCs display dynamic gene expression over time; for instance, early RGCs express higher levels of Hes5, and late RGCs show higher expression of Pou3f2. Interestingly, intermediate progenitor cell marker gene Eomes coexpresses temporally with known neuronal identity genes at different developmental stages, though mostly in postmitotic cells. Our results delineate neural progenitor cell diversity in the developing mouse neocortex and support that neuronal identity genes are transcriptionally evident in Eomes-positive cells.}

  abstract = {Vertical transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) leads with high frequency to congenital ZIKV syndrome (CZS), whose worst outcome is microcephaly. However, the mechanisms of congenital ZIKV neurodevelopmental pathologies, including direct cytotoxicity to neural progenitor cells (NPC), placental insufficiency, and immune responses, remain incompletely understood. At the cellular level, microcephaly typically results from death or insufficient proliferation of NPC or cortical neurons. NPC replicate fast, requiring efficient DNA damage responses to ensure genome stability. Like congenital ZIKV infection, mutations in the polynucleotide 5'-kinase 3'-phosphatase (PNKP) gene, which encodes a critical DNA damage repair enzyme, result in recessive syndromes often characterized by congenital microcephaly with seizures (MCSZ). We thus tested whether there were any links between ZIKV and PNKP. Here, we show that two PNKP phosphatase inhibitors or PNKP knockout inhibited ZIKV replication. PNKP relocalized from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in infected cells, colocalizing with the marker of ZIKV replication factories (RF) NS1 and resulting in functional nuclear PNKP depletion. Although infected NPC accumulated DNA damage, they failed to activate the DNA damage checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2. ZIKV also induced activation of cytoplasmic CycA/CDK1 complexes, which trigger unscheduled mitotic entry. Inhibition of CDK1 activity inhibited ZIKV replication and the formation of RF, supporting a role of cytoplasmic CycA/CDK1 in RF morphogenesis. In brief, ZIKV infection induces mitotic catastrophe resulting from unscheduled mitotic entry in the presence of DNA damage. PNKP and CycA/CDK1 are thus host factors participating in ZIKV replication in NPC, and pathogenesis to neural progenitor cells. IMPORTANCE The 2015-2017 Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in Brazil and subsequent international epidemic revealed the strong association between ZIKV infection and congenital malformations, mostly neurodevelopmental defects up to microcephaly. The scale and global expansion of the epidemic, the new ZIKV outbreaks (Kerala state, India, 2021), and the potential burden of future ones pose a serious ongoing risk. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms resulting in microcephaly remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that ZIKV infection of neuronal progenitor cells results in cytoplasmic sequestration of an essential DNA repair protein itself associated with microcephaly, with the consequent accumulation of DNA damage, together with an unscheduled activation of cytoplasmic CDK1/Cyclin A complexes in the presence of DNA damage. These alterations result in mitotic catastrophe of neuronal progenitors, which would lead to a depletion of cortical neurons during development.},

This precludes the detection of many long non-coding, short non-coding and non-polyadenylated protein-coding transcripts and hinders alternative splicing analysis. We, therefore, developed VASA-seq to detect the total transcriptome in single cells, which is enabled by fragmenting and tailing all RNA molecules subsequent to cell lysis. The method is compatible with both plate-based formats and droplet microfluidics. We applied VASA-seq to more than 30,000 single cells in the developing mouse embryo during gastrulation and early organogenesis. Analyzing the dynamics of the total single-cell transcriptome, we discovered cell type markers, many based on non-coding RNA, and performed in vivo cell cycle analysis via detection of non-polyadenylated histone genes. RNA velocity characterization was improved, accurately retracing blood maturation trajectories. Moreover, our VASA-seq data provide a comprehensive analysis of alternative splicing during mammalian development, which highlighted substantial rearrangements during blood development and heart morphogenesis.},

Within the nervous system, cellular and environmental determinants tightly control the expansion and differentiation of neural stem cells. Importantly, a number of studies have indicated that changes in cell cycle length can influence development and physiopathology of the nervous system, and might have played a role during evolution of the mammalian brain. Specifically, it has been suggested that the length of G1 can directly influence the differentiation of neural precursors. This has prompted the proposal of a model to explain how manipulation of G1 length can be used to expand neural stem cells. If validated in non-neural systems, this model might provide the means to control the proliferation vs. differentiation of somatic stem cells, which will represent a significant advance in the field.},

Some of the developed strategies can be performed not only in aqueous solution but also in the presence of cellular components, as well as on (or even in) living cells. These labeling strategies require the initial, specific modification of the target molecule with a small, reactive moiety. In the second step, a click reaction is used to covalently couple a reporter molecule to the biomolecule. Depending on the type of reporter, labeling by the click reaction can be used in many different applications, ranging from isolation to functional studies of biomacromolecules. In this minireview, we focus on labeling strategies for RNA that rely on the click reaction. We first highlight click reactions that have been used successfully to label modified RNA, and then describe different strategies to introduce the required reactive groups into target RNA. The benefits and potential limitations of the strategies are critically discussed with regard to possible future developments.},

Good theories guide empirical research, allowing us to interpret data, develop new experimental techniques and expand our capacity to manipulate the phenomenon of interest. Indeed, it is only when couched in terms of a theory that empirical discoveries can ultimately deliver a satisfying understanding of a phenomenon. However, in the case of consciousness, it is unclear how current theories relate to each other, or whether they can be empirically distinguished. To clarify this complicated landscape, we review four prominent theoretical approaches to consciousness: higher-order theories, global workspace theories, re-entry and predictive processing theories and integrated information theory. We describe the key characteristics of each approach by identifying which aspects of consciousness they propose to explain, what their neurobiological commitments are and what empirical data are adduced in their support. We consider how some prominent empirical debates might distinguish among these theories, and we outline three ways in which theories need to be developed to deliver a mature regimen of theory-testing in the neuroscience of consciousness. There are good reasons to think that the iterative development, testing and comparison of theories of consciousness will lead to a deeper understanding of this most profound of mysteries.},

Such efforts are increasingly emphasizing the production of high-accuracy sequence corresponding to the entire insert of cDNA clones, especially those presumed to reflect the full-length mRNA. The complete sequencing of cDNA clones on a large scale presents unique challenges because of the generally small, yet heterogeneous, sizes of the cloned inserts. We have developed a strategy for high-throughput sequencing of cDNA clones using the transposon Tn5. This approach has been tailored for implementation within an existing large-scale `shotgun-style' sequencing program, although it could be readily adapted for use in virtually any sequencing environment. In addition, we have developed a modified version of our strategy that can be applied to cDNA clones with large cloning vectors, thereby overcoming a potential limitation of transposon-based approaches. Here we describe the details of our cDNA-sequencing pipeline, including a summary of the experience in sequencing more than 4200 cDNA clones to produce more than 8 million base pairs of high-accuracy cDNA sequence. These data provide both convincing evidence that the insertion of Tn5 into cDNA clones is sufficiently random for its effective use in large-scale cDNA sequencing as well as interesting insight about the sequence context preferred for insertion by Tn5.}

This activity depends most highly on residues -11, -9, -8, -7, and +1 (initiation site). All substitutions at -11, -9, -8, and -7 abolished formation of closed complexes, except for A-8C. These residues are involved in base-specific interactions with the polymerase, and the substitutions exhibit the same strong inhibition in vitro. In contrast, the in vitro activities of some other variants, measured on linearized templates, were different from those in vivo. Some variants at -13, -4, and -2, among others, showed exceptionally higher activities in vivo than in vitro, supporting the possibility that these residues are involved in postbinding steps, including template melting and bending. The A-3T variant showed much lower activity in vivo than in vitro, but it bound to the polymerase 2-fold more than the consensus sequence and is possibly involved in polymerase binding. A quantitative hierarchy of all the base pairs is graphically displayed by activity logos, revealing the energetic contribution of each base pair to the activity.}

Here, we develop single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) HDR templates (HDRTs) incorporating CTSs with reduced toxicity that boost knock-in efficiency and yield by an average of around two- to threefold relative to dsDNA CTSs. Using small-molecule combinations that enhance HDR, we could further increase knock-in efficiencies by an additional roughly two- to threefold on average. Our method works across a variety of target loci, knock-in constructs and primary human cell types, reaching HDR efficiencies of {$>$}80\textendash 90\%. We demonstrate application of this approach for both pathogenic gene variant modeling and gene-replacement strategies for IL2RA and CTLA4 mutations associated with Mendelian disorders. Finally, we develop a good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compatible process for nonviral chimeric antigen receptor-T cell manufacturing, with knock-in efficiencies (46\textendash 62\%) and yields ({$>$}1.5\,\texttimes\,109 modified cells) exceeding those of conventional approaches.},

The rate of the cleavage reaction is strongly affected by the identity of the metal cation present in the reaction solution; however, the mechanism(s) by which different cations contribute to rate enhancement has not been determined. Using the Neurospora VS ribozyme, we provide evidence that different cations confer particular shifts in the apparent pK a values of the catalytic nucleobases, which in turn determines the fraction of RNA in the protonation state competent for general acid\textendash base catalysis at a given pH, which determines the observed rate of the cleavage reaction. Despite large differences in observed rates of cleavage in different cations, mathematical models of general acid\textendash base catalysis indicate that k 1, the intrinsic rate of the bond-breaking step, is essentially constant irrespective of the identity of the cation(s) in the reaction solution. Thus, in contrast to models that invoke unique roles for metal ions in ribozyme chemical mechanisms, we find that most, and possibly all, of the ion-specific rate enhancement in the VS ribozyme can be explained solely by the effect of the ions on nucleobase pK a. The inference that k 1 is essentially constant suggests a resolution of the problem of kinetic ambiguity in favor of a model in which the lower pK a is that of the general acid and the higher pK a is that of the general base.},

Recent advances in the concurrent detection of multiple such analogues offer new avenues for the investigation of unknown features of these vital cellular processes. Combined with quantitative analysis, temporal discrimination of multiple labels enables elucidation of various aspects of stem cell life cycle in situ, such as division modes, differentiation, maintenance, and elimination. Data obtained from such experiments are critically important for creating descriptive models of tissue histogenesis and renewal in embryonic development and adult life. Despite the wide use of thymidine analogues in stem cell research, there are a number of caveats to consider for obtaining valid and reliable labeling results when marking replicating DNA with nucleotide analogues. Therefore, in this review, we describe critical points regarding dosage, delivery, and detection of nucleotide analogues in the context of single and multiple labeling, outline labeling schemes based on pulse-chase, cumulative and multilabel marking of replicating DNA for revealing stem cell proliferative behaviors, and determining cell cycle parameters, and discuss preconditions and pitfalls in conducting such experiments. The information presented in our review is important for rational design of experiments on tracking dividing stem cells by marking replicating DNA with thymidine analogues.},

Existing solutions based on machine learning typically train a model to directly map measurements to medical images, leveraging a training dataset of paired images and measurements. These measurements are typically synthesized from images using a fixed physical model of the measurement process, which hinders the generalization capability of models to unknown measurement processes. To address this issue, we propose a fully unsupervised technique for inverse problem solving, leveraging the recently introduced score-based generative models. Specifically, we first train a score-based generative model on medical images to capture their prior distribution. Given measurements and a physical model of the measurement process at test time, we introduce a sampling method to reconstruct an image consistent with both the prior and the observed measurements. Our method does not assume a fixed measurement process during training, and can thus be flexibly adapted to different measurement processes at test time. Empirically, we observe comparable or better performance to supervised learning techniques in several medical imaging tasks in CT and MRI, while demonstrating significantly better generalization to unknown measurement processes.},

  abstract = {Widely observed neural scaling laws, in which error falls off as a power of the training set size, model size, or both, have driven substantial performance improvements in deep learning. However, these improvements through scaling alone require considerable costs in compute and energy. Here we focus on the scaling of error with dataset size and show how both in theory and practice we can break beyond power law scaling and reduce it to exponential scaling instead if we have access to a high-quality data pruning metric that ranks the order in which training examples should be discarded to achieve any pruned dataset size. We then test this new exponential scaling prediction with pruned dataset size empirically, and indeed observe better than power law scaling performance on ResNets trained on CIFAR-10, SVHN, and ImageNet. Given the importance of finding high-quality pruning metrics, we perform the first large-scale benchmarking study of ten different data pruning metrics on ImageNet. We find most existing high performing metrics scale poorly to ImageNet, while the best are computationally intensive and require labels for every image. We therefore developed a new simple, cheap and scalable self-supervised pruning metric that demonstrates comparable performance to the best supervised metrics. Overall, our work suggests that the discovery of good data-pruning metrics may provide a viable path forward to substantially improved neural scaling laws, thereby reducing the resource costs of modern deep learning.},

Most progress to address the connection between cell fate and the cell cycle has been made in pluripotent stem cells, in which the transition through mitosis and G1 phase is crucial for establishing a window of opportunity for pluripotency exit and the initiation of differentiation.

This diverse `toolkit' of genes correlates with critical aspects of all metazoan body plans, and comprises cell cycle control and growth, development, somatic- and germ-cell specification, cell adhesion, innate immunity and allorecognition.

While the molecular mechanisms that regulate the proliferative cell cycle are well established, we know comparatively little about what happens to cells as they diverge into cell cycle arrest. We performed hyperplexed imaging of 47 cell cycle effectors to obtain a map of the molecular architecture that governs cell cycle exit and progression into reversible (?quiescent?) and irreversible (?senescent?) arrest states. Using this map, we found multiple points of divergence from the proliferative cell cycle; identified stress-specific states of arrest; and resolved the molecular mechanisms governing these fate decisions, which we validated by single-cell, time-lapse imaging. Notably, we found that cells can exit into senescence from either G1 or G2; however, both subpopulations converge onto a single senescent state with a G1-like molecular signature. Cells can escape from this ?irreversible? arrest state through the upregulation of G1 cyclins. This map provides a more comprehensive understanding of the overall organization of cell proliferation and arrest.},

We combined time-lapse microscopy, highly multiplexed single-cell imaging of 48 core cell cycle proteins, and manifold learning to render a visualization of the human cell cycle. This data-driven approach revealed the comprehensive ``structure'' of the cell cycle: a continuum of molecular states that cells occupy as they transition from one cell division to the next, or as they enter or exit cell cycle arrest. Paradoxically, progression deeper into cell cycle arrest was accompanied by increases in proliferative effectors such as CDKs and cyclins, which can drive cell cycle re-entry by overcoming p21 induction. The structure also revealed the molecular trajectories into senescence and the unique combination of molecular features that define this irreversibly arrested state. This approach will enable the comparison of alternative cell cycles during development, in response to environmental perturbation and in disease.

  abstract = {Long-term tissue homeostasis requires a precise balance between stem cell self-renewal and the generation of differentiated progeny. Recently, it has been shown that in the adult murine brain, neural stem cells (NSCs) divide mostly symmetrically. This finding suggests that the required balance for tissue homeostasis is accomplished at the population level. However, it remains unclear how this balance is enabled. Furthermore, there is experimental evidence that proneural differentiation factors not only promote differentiation, but also cell cycle progression, suggesting a link between the two processes in NSCs. To study the effect of such a link on NSC dynamics, we developed a stochastic model in which stem cells have an intrinsic probability to progress through cell cycle and to differentiate. Our results show that increasing heterogeneity in differentiation probabilities leads to a decreased probability of long-term tissue homeostasis, and that this effect can be compensated when cell cycle progression and differentiation are positively coupled. Using single-cell RNA-Seq profiling of adult NSCs, we found a positive correlation in the expression levels of cell cycle and differentiation markers. Our findings suggest that a coupling between cell cycle progression and differentiation on the cellular level is part of the process that maintains tissue homeostasis in the adult brain.},

Single-cell technology is now allowing us to probe molecular mechanisms and processes at unprecedented detail, and there is hope that we can learn better, more detailed network models from such data, to help us understand the mechanisms underlying cellular processes. However, learning the structure of networks is notoriously difficult for at least two reasons: (i) network inference is a statistically challenging problem~and (ii) the naive picture of static networks may be fundamentally inapplicable to the description of biological systems. Here, I will give some overview of the basic problem, discuss a set of promising network inference methods and how to validate them~and outline how we can go beyond the limitations imposed by static network models.},

  abstract = {Pluripotent stem cells can self-renew in culture and differentiate along all somatic lineages in~vivo. While much is known about the molecular basis of pluripotency, the mechanisms of differentiation remain unclear. Here, we profile individual mouse embryonic stem cells as they progress along the neuronal lineage. We observe that cells pass from the pluripotent state to the neuronal state via an intermediate epiblast-like state. However, analysis of the rate at which cells enter and exit these observed cell states using a hidden Markov model indicates the presence of a chain of unobserved molecular states that each cell transits through stochastically in sequence. This chain of hidden states allows individual cells to~record their position on the differentiation trajectory, thereby encoding a simple form of cellular memory. We suggest a statistical mechanics interpretation of these results that distinguishes between functionally distinct cellular ``macrostates'' and functionally similar molecular ``microstates'' and propose a model of stem cell differentiation as a non-Markov stochastic process.},

Depletion of circSlc45a4 in the developing mouse cortex causes a significant reduction of the basal progenitor pool and increases the expression of neurogenic regulators. Furthermore, knockdown of circSlc45a4a induces a significant depletion of cells in the cortical plate. In addition, deconvolution of the bulk RNA-seq data with the help of single-cell RNA-seq data validates the depletion of basal progenitors and reveals an increase in Cajal-Retzius cells. In summary, we present a detailed study of a highly conserved circular RNA that is necessary to maintain the pool of neural progenitors in~vitro and in~vivo.},

Stretching a single ssDNA-SSB complex reveals discrete states that correlate with known binding modes, the likely ssDNA conformations and diffusion dynamics in each, and the kinetic pathways by which the protein wraps ssDNA and is dissociated. The data allow us to construct an energy landscape for the ssDNA-SSB complex, revealing that unwrapping energy costs increase the more ssDNA is unraveled. Our findings provide insights into the mechanism by which proteins gain access to ssDNA bound by SSB, as demonstrated by experiments in which SSB is displaced by the E. coli recombinase RecA.},

It has been shown that the inhibition occurs mostly when a small amount of RNA is taken for RT reaction, and it is more visible for rarely expressed transcripts. We show here that the inhibition takes place regardless of what amount of template is utilized for RT. The inhibition possesses a global nature, i.e. the amplification of any given transcript may be compromised with different levels of inhibition. The process of inhibition also explains wrongfully derived PCR amplification efficiencies, sometimes more than 100\%, when the sequential dilutions of unpurified RT sample are utilized to build the calibration curve. The RT influences PCR not only by inhibiting it. When microgram(s) of RNA are taken for RT reaction, reverse transcriptase may cause overamplification of some transcripts under certain PCR conditions. The possible mechanism of RT influence on PCR is presented, and a purification method is implemented to remove the effects of RT on PCR.},

One approach to the problem is to perform a power analysis for a univariate objective such as differential expression. However, many of the goals of single-cell analysis requires consideration of the multivariate structure of gene expression, such as clustering. We introduce an approach to quantifying the impact of sequencing depth and cell number on the estimation of a multivariate generative model for gene expression that is based on error analysis in the framework of a variational autoencoder. We find that at shallow depths, the marginal benefit of deeper sequencing per cell significantly outweighs the benefit of increased cell numbers. Above about 15,000 reads per cell the benefit of increased sequencing depth is minor.

The associated increase in efficiency has enabled more economical bulk RNA sequencing methods and the advent of high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing, already one of the most widely adopted methods in transcriptomics. However, the effects of off-target oligo(dT) priming on gene expression quantification have not been appreciated. In the present study, we describe the extent, the possible causes, and the consequences of internal oligo(dT) priming across multiple public datasets obtained from various bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing platforms. To explore and address this issue, we developed a computational algorithm for RNA counting methods, which identifies the sequencing read alignments that likely resulted from internal oligo(dT) priming and removes them from the data. Directly comparing filtered datasets to those obtained by an alternative method reveals significant improvements in gene expression measurement. Finally, we infer a list of human genes whose expression quantification is most likely to be affected by internal oligo(dT) priming and predict that when measured using these methods, the expression of most genes may be inflated by at least 10\% whereby some genes are affected more than others.}

Putative markers of biological processes are often used to evaluate the biological basis of male sexual orientation, including fraternal birth order, handedness, and familiality of same-sex sexual orientation; these biomarkers are proxies for immunological, endocrine, and genetic mechanisms. Here, we used latent profile analysis (LPA) to assess whether these biomarkers cluster within the same individuals or are present in different subgroups of nonheterosexual men. LPA defined four profiles of men based on these biomarkers: 1) A subgroup who did not have these biomarkers, 2) fraternal birth order, 3) handedness, and 4) familiality. While the majority of both heterosexual and nonheterosexual men were grouped in the profile that did not have any biomarker, the three profiles associated with a biomarker were composed primarily of nonheterosexual men. We then evaluated whether these subgroups differed on measures of gender nonconformity and personality that reliably show male sexual orientation differences. The subgroup without biomarkers was the most gender-conforming whereas the fraternal birth order subgroup was the most female-typical and agreeable, compared with the other profiles. Together, these findings suggest there are multiple distinct biodevelopmental pathways influencing same-sex sexual orientation in men.},

  abstract = {Stem cell engineering is a powerful platform to address numerous challenges in regenerative medicine and developmental biology. Typically, engineered populations are derived by exposing pluripotent stem cells to a series of signaling cues meant to recapitulate developmental milestones, such as the induction of the primitive streak. Morphologic, genetic, transcriptomic, and functional differences between fully differentiated in vivo and engineered populations have long been recognized. However, the correspondence between engineered and native embryonic progenitors has been relatively less well characterized, largely due to their transient and highly heterogenous nature, and therefore many studies have relied on expression of a few canonical markers to ensure that their cells are on the correct path. To address this challenge, we first generated an in vivo gastrulation mouse single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) reference data set and used it to train a collection of computational tools for comparing cell types, states, regulators, and trajectories across studies. Then we used these tools to evaluate a commonly used protocol designed to promote mesoderm derivation, as well as four previously published biomimetic protocols. Finally, we diversified our toolkits to reach a broader scientific community by implementing our primary analysis tool in Python and as an interactive web application.},

As such, BrdU is used for birth dating and monitoring cell proliferation. BrdU immunohistochemistry has been instrumental for the study of the development of the nervous system, and to confirm that neurogenesis occurs in the adult mammalian brain, including in human. However, the use of BrdU for studying neurogenesis is not without pitfalls and limitations. BrdU is a toxic and mutagenic substance. It triggers cell death, the formation of teratomas, alters DNA stability, lengthens the cell cycle, and has mitogenic, transcriptional and translational effects on cells that incorporate it. All of which have profound consequences on neurogenesis. BrdU is not a marker of the S-phase of the cell cycle. As a thymidine analog, it is a marker of DNA synthesis. Therefore, studying neurogenesis with BrdU requires distinguishing cell proliferation and neurogenesis from other events involving DNA synthesis, like DNA repair, abortive cell cycle reentry and gene duplication. BrdU labeling is currently the most used technique for studying adult neurogenesis in situ. However in many instances, appropriate controls have been overlooked and events reported as the generation of new neuronal cells in the adult brain misinterpreted, which makes BrdU labeling one of the most misused techniques in neuroscience.},

How neuronal identity is dynamically specified upon progenitor division is unknown. Here, we study this process using a high-temporal-resolution technology allowing fluorescent tagging of isochronic cohorts of newborn VZ cells. By combining this in vivo approach with single-cell transcriptomics in mice, we identify and functionally characterize neuron-specific primordial transcriptional programs as they dynamically unfold. Our results reveal early transcriptional waves that instruct the sequence and pace of neuronal differentiation events, guiding newborn neurons toward their final fate, and contribute to a road map for the reverse engineering of specific classes of cortical neurons from undifferentiated cells.},

I argue that the most pressing philosophical questions at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence are ultimately concerned with defining the phenomena to be explained and with what constitute valid explanations of such phenomena. I propose that a foundation in the philosophy of scientific explanation and understanding can scaffold future discussions about how an integrated science of intelligence might progress.

In apparently identical cells, the activity of signaling effectors can vary considerably, raising questions about the accuracy of cellular signaling and the interpretation of heterogeneous responses, as either functional or simply noise. Cell-to-cell variability of signaling outcomes, signaling dynamics, and cross-wiring all give rise to signaling complexity, complicating the analysis of signaling mechanisms.

Why long-lived proteins exist in metabolically active cellular environments and how they are maintained over time remains poorly understood. Here, we provide a system-wide identification of proteins with exceptional lifespans in the rat brain. These proteins are inefficiently replenished despite being translated robustly throughout adulthood. Using nucleoporins as a paradigm for long-term protein persistence, we found that nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are maintained over a cell's life through slow but finite exchange of even its most stable subcomplexes. This maintenance is limited, however, as some nucleoporin levels decrease during aging, providing a rationale for the previously observed age-dependent deterioration of NPC function. Our identification of a long-lived proteome reveals cellular components that are at increased risk for damage accumulation, linking long-term protein persistence to the cellular aging process.

While more DNA adsorbed to silica using chaotropic salts, certain buffer conditions without chaotropic salts yielded a similar amount of eluted DNA. QCM results indicate that under stronger adsorbing conditions, the adsorbed DNA layer is initially rigid, but becomes viscoelastic within minutes. These results qualitatively agreed with a mathematical model for a multiphasic adsorption process. Buffer conditions that do not require chaotropic salts can simplify protocols for nucleic acid sample preparation.

Lineage tracing aims to identify all progeny arising from an individual cell, placing them within a lineage hierarchy. The recent emergence of genomic technologies, such as single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, has fostered sophisticated new methods to reconstruct lineage relationships at high resolution. In contrast, fate maps, schematics showing which parts of the embryo will develop into which tissue, have remained relatively static since the 1970s. However, fate maps provide spatial information, often lost in lineage reconstruction, that can offer fundamental mechanistic insight into development. Here, we broadly review the origins of fate mapping and lineage tracing approaches. We focus on the most recent developments in lineage tracing, permitted by advances in single-cell genomics. Finally, we explore the current potential to leverage these new technologies to synthesize high-resolution fate maps and discuss their potential for interrogating development at new depths.},

Integrated with a machine learning approach, this technology achieves single-codon resolution. We validate this method by demonstrating that limitation for a particular amino acid causes ribosome pausing at a subset of the codons encoding the amino acid. Of note, this pausing is only observed in a sub-population of cells correlating to its cell cycle state. We further expand on this phenomenon in non-limiting conditions and detect pronounced GAA pausing during mitosis. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of this technique to rare primary enteroendocrine cells.

However, effective synchronization of mammalian cells is commonly achieved by long exposure to one or more cell cycle blocking agents. These chemicals are, by definition, hazardous (some more than others), pose uneven cell cycle arrest, thus introducing unwanted variables. The challenge of synchronizing proliferating cells in G1 is even greater; this process typically involves the release of drug-arrested cells into the cycle that follows, a heterogeneous process that can truly limit synchronization. Moreover, drug-based synchronization decouples the cell cycle from cell growth in ways that are understudied and intolerable for those who investigate the relationship between these two processes. In this study we showed that cell size, as approximated by a single light-scatter parameter available in all standard sorters, can be used for synchronizing proliferating mammalian cells in G1 with minimal or no risk to either the cell cycle or cell growth. The power and selectivity of our method are demonstrated for human HEK293 cells that, despite their many advantages, are suboptimal for synchronization, let alone in G1. Our approach is readily available, simple, fast, and inexpensive; it is independent of any drugs or dyes, and nonhazardous. These properties are relevant for the study of the mammalian cell cycle, specifically in the context of G1 and cell growth.},

  abstract = {The dynamic behavior of proteins is critical for cellular homeostasis. However, analyzing dynamics of proteins and protein complexes in vivo has been difficult. Here we describe recombination-induced tag exchange (RITE), a genetic method that induces a permanent epitope-tag switch in the coding sequence after a hormone-induced activation of Cre recombinase. The time-controlled tag switch provides a unique ability to detect and separate old and new proteins in time and space, which opens up opportunities to investigate the dynamic behavior of proteins. We validated the technology by determining exchange of endogenous histones in chromatin by biochemical methods and by visualizing and quantifying replacement of old by new proteasomes in single cells by microscopy. RITE is widely applicable and allows probing spatiotemporal changes in protein properties by multiple methods.}

We explore risk loci where TWAS accurately prioritizes the likely causal gene as well as loci where TWAS prioritizes multiple genes, some likely to be non-causal, owing to sharing of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). TWAS is especially prone to spurious prioritization with expression data from non-trait-related tissues or cell types, owing to substantial cross-cell-type variation in expression levels and eQTL strengths. Nonetheless, TWAS prioritizes candidate causal genes more accurately than simple baselines. We suggest best practices for causal-gene prioritization with TWAS and discuss future opportunities for improvement. Our results showcase the strengths and limitations of using eQTL datasets to determine causal genes at GWAS loci.},

Recently, the need for scRNA-seq sample fixation has emerged in many scenarios, such as when samples need long-term transportation, or when experiments need to be temporally synchronized. Methanol fixation is a simple and gentle method that has been routinely applied in scRNA-seq. Yet, concerns remain that fixation may result in biases which may change the RNA-seq outcome. Results: We adapted an existing methanol fixation protocol and performed scRNA-seq on both live and methanol fixed cells. Analyses of the results show methanol fixation can faithfully preserve biological related signals, while the discrepancy caused by fixation is subtle and relevant to library construction methods. By grouping transcripts based on their lengths and GC content, we find that transcripts with different features are affected by fixation to different degrees in full-length sequencing data, while the effect is alleviated in Drop-seq result. Conclusions: Our deep analysis reveals the effects of methanol fixation on sample RNA integrity and elucidates the potential consequences of using fixation in various scRNA-seq experiment designs.}

Here, we used a DNA-based signal amplification method, Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR), to replace secondary antibodies to achieve multiplexed imaging using primary antibodies of the same species with superior signal intensity. To enable imaging with DNA-conjugated antibodies, we developed a new antibody staining protocol to minimize nonspecific binding of antibodies caused by conjugated DNA oligonucleotides. We also expanded the HCR hairpin pool from previously published 5 to 13 for highly multiplexed in situ imaging. We finally demonstrated multiplexed in situ protein imaging using the technique in both cultured cells and mouse retina sections.},

Ethynyl-modified nucleosides were used to metabolically label newly synthesized adenovirus, herpes virus, and vaccinia virus vDNA, without affecting infectivity. Superresolution microscopy and copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (click) reactions allowed visualization of infection at single vDNA resolution within mammalian cells. Analysis of adenovirus infection revealed that a large pool of capsid-free vDNA accumulated in the cytosol upon virus uncoating, indicating that nuclear import of incoming vDNA is a bottleneck.

  abstract = {RNA hydrolysis presents problems in manufacturing, long-term storage, world-wide delivery~and in vivo stability of messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines and therapeutics. A largely unexplored strategy to reduce mRNA hydrolysis is to redesign RNAs to form double-stranded regions, which are protected from in-line cleavage and enzymatic degradation, while coding for the same proteins. The amount of stabilization that this strategy can deliver and the most effective algorithmic approach to achieve stabilization remain poorly understood. Here, we present simple calculations for estimating RNA stability against hydrolysis, and a model that links the average unpaired probability of an mRNA, or AUP, to its overall hydrolysis rate. To characterize the stabilization achievable through structure design, we compare AUP optimization by conventional mRNA design methods to results from more computationally sophisticated algorithms and crowdsourcing through the OpenVaccine challenge on the Eterna platform. We find that rational design on Eterna and the more sophisticated algorithms lead to constructs with low AUP, which we term `superfolder' mRNAs. These designs exhibit a wide diversity of sequence and structure features that may be desirable for translation, biophysical size, and immunogenicity. Furthermore, their folding is robust to temperature, computer modeling method, choice of flanking untranslated regions, and changes in target protein sequence, as illustrated by rapid redesign of superfolder mRNAs for B.1.351, P.1~and B.1.1.7 variants of the prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Increases in in vitro mRNA half-life by at least two-fold appear immediately achievable.}

  abstract = {This protocol describes a method to permit the tracking of cells through the cell cycle without requiring the cells to be synchronized. Achieving cell synchronization can be difficult for many cell systems. Standard practice is to block cell cycle progression at a specific stage and then release the accumulated cells producing a wave of cells progressing through the cycle in unison. However, some cell types find this block toxic resulting in abnormal cell cycling, or even mass death. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) uptake can be used to track the cell cycle stage of individual cells. Cells incorporate this synthetic thymidine analog, while synthesizing new DNA during S phase. By providing BrdU for a brief period it is possible to mark a pool of cells that were in S phase while the BrdU was present. These cells can then be tracked through the remainder of the cell cycle and into the next round of replication, permitting the duration of the cell cycle phases to be determined without the need to induce a potentially toxic cell cycle block. It is also possible to determine and correlate the expression of both internal and external proteins during subsequent stages of the cell cycle. These can be used to further refine the assignment of cell cycle stage or assess effects on other cellular functions such as checkpoint activation or cell death.},

The techniques for doublet determination are often used interchangeably without regard for the complexity in cell shapes and sizes of biological specimens. G0/1 doublets were identified and quantitated using fluorescence height versus area and fluorescence width versus area pulse measurements, by enumerating the proportion of G2 + M cells that lack cyclin B1 immunoreactivity, and modeled in the DNA histograms by software algorithms. These techniques were tested on propidium iodide-stained whole epithelial cells or nuclei from asynchronous cultures, or after exposure to chemotherapeutic agents that induced cell-cycle arrest and were extended to human breast tumor specimens having DNA diploid patterns. G0/1 doublets were easily discernible from G2 + M singlets in cells or nuclei that are generally homogenous and spherical in shape. Doublet discrimination based on pulse processing or cyclin B1 measurements was nonconcordant in some nonspherical cell types and in cells following cell cycle arrest. Significant differences in G0/1 doublet estimates were observed in breast tumor specimens (n = 50), with estimates based on pulse width twice those of pulse height and nearly five times greater than computer estimates. Differences between techniques are attributed to difficulties in the separation of the boundaries between G0/1 doublets and G2 + M singlet populations in biologically heterogeneous specimens. To improve reproducibility and enhance standardization among laboratories performing cell cycle analysis in experimental cell systems and in human breast tumors, doublet discrimination analysis should best be accomplished by computer modeling. Shape and size heterogeneity of tumor and arrested cells using pulse-processing can lead to errors and make interlaboratory comparison difficult. Cytometry (Comm. Clin.

Here, we develop a comprehensive spatiotemporal map of bipolar subtype genesis in the murine retina. Combining multiplexed detection of 16 RNA markers with timed delivery of 5-ethynyl uridine (EdU) and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), we analyze more than 30,000 single cells in full retinal sections to classify all bipolar subtypes and their birthdates. We find that bipolar subtype birthdates are ordered and follow a centrifugal developmental axis. Spatial analysis reveals a striking wave pattern of bipolar subtype birthdates, and lineage analyses suggest clonal restriction on homotypic subtype production. These results inspire a hierarchical developmental model, with ordered subtype genesis within lineages.

However, the low detection efficiency of current methods has limited our understanding of the true complexity of chromatin accessibility and its relationship with gene expression in single cells. Here, we report a high-sensitivity scATAC-seq method, termed multiplexed end-tagging amplification of transposase accessible chromatin (METATAC), which detects a large number of accessible sites per cell and is compatible with automation. Our high detectability and statistical framework allowed precise linking of enhancers to promoters without merging single cells. We systematically investigated allele-specific accessibility in the mouse cerebral cortex, revealing allele-specific accessibility of promotors of certain imprinted genes but biallelic accessibility of their enhancers. Finally, we combined METATAC with our high-sensitivity single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) method, multiple annealing and looping based amplification cycles for digital transcriptomics (MALBAC-DT), to develop a joint ATAC\textendash RNA assay, termed METATAC and MALBAC-DT coassay by sequencing (M2C-seq).

Many scRNA-Seq approaches rely upon the template switching property of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV)-type reverse transcriptases. Template switching is believed to happen in a sequential process involving nontemplated addition of three protruding nucleotides (+CCC) to the 3{${'}$}-end of the nascent cDNA, which can then anneal to the matching rGrGrG 3{${'}$}-end of the template-switching oligo (TSO), allowing the reverse transcriptase (RT) to switch templates and continue copying the TSO sequence. In this study, we present a detailed analysis of template switching biases with respect to the RNA template, specifically of the role of the sequence and nature of its 5{${'}$}-end (capped \emph{versus} noncapped) in these biases. Our findings confirmed that the presence of a 5{${'}$}-m\textsuperscript{7}G cap enhances template switching efficiency. We also profiled the composition of the nontemplated addition in the absence of TSO and observed that the 5{${'}$}-end of RNA template influences the terminal transferase activity of the RT. Furthermore, we found that designing new TSOs that pair with the most common nontemplated additions did little to improve template switching efficiency. Our results provide evidence suggesting that, in contrast to the current understanding of the template switching process, nontemplated addition and template switching are concurrent and competing processes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The assembly of DNA fragments with homologous arms is becoming popular in routine cloning. For an in vitro assembly reaction, a DNA polymerase is often used either alone for its 3{${'}$}-5{${'}$} exonuclease activity or together with a 5{${'}$}-3{${'}$} exonuclease for its DNA polymerase activity. Here, we present a `T5 exonuclease DNA assembly' (TEDA) method that only uses a 5{${'}$}-3{${'}$} exonuclease. DNA fragments with short homologous ends were treated by T5 exonuclease and then transformed into Escherichia coli to produce clone colonies. The cloning efficiency was similar to that of the commercial In-Fusion method employing a proprietary DNA polymerase, but higher than that of the Gibson method utilizing T5 exonuclease, Phusion DNA polymerase, and DNA ligase. It also assembled multiple DNA fragments and did simultaneous site-directed mutagenesis at multiple sites. The reaction mixture was simple, and each reaction used 0.04 U of T5 exonuclease that cost 0.25 US cents. The simplicity, cost effectiveness, and cloning efficiency should promote its routine use, especially for labs with a budget constraint. TEDA may trigger further development of DNA assembly methods that employ single exonucleases.}

  abstract = {In mammals, translational control plays critical roles during oocyte-to-embryo transition (OET) when transcription ceases. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain challenging to study. Here, using low-input Ribo-seq (Ribo-lite), we investigated translational landscapes during OET using 30\textendash 150 mouse oocytes or embryos per stage. Ribo-lite can also accommodate single oocytes. Combining PAIso-seq to interrogate poly(A) tail lengths, we found a global switch of translatome that closely parallels changes of poly(A) tails upon meiotic resumption. Translation activation correlates with polyadenylation and is supported by polyadenylation signal proximal cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (papCPEs) in 3{${'}$} untranslated regions. By contrast, translation repression parallels global de-adenylation. The latter includes transcripts containing no CPEs or non-papCPEs, which encode many transcription regulators that are preferentially re-activated before zygotic genome activation. CCR4-NOT, the major de-adenylation complex, and its key adaptor protein BTG4 regulate translation downregulation often independent of RNA decay. BTG4 is not essential for global de-adenylation but is required for selective gene de-adenylation and production of very short-tailed transcripts. In sum, our data reveal intimate interplays among translation, RNA stability and poly(A) tail length regulation underlying mammalian OET.},

This reaction permits us to conjugate an environment-sensitive fluorophore site specifically onto HdeA, an acid-stress chaperone that adopts pH-dependent conformational changes, in both the periplasm and cytoplasm of E. coli. The resulting protein\textendash fluorophore hybrid pH indicators enable compartment-specific pH measurement to determine the pH gradient across the E. coli cytoplasmic membrane.

Randomized, tightly controlled experiments are enshrined as the gold standard of psychological research, and there are endless investigations of the various mediating and moderating variables that govern various behaviors. We argue that psychology's near-total focus on explaining the causes of behavior has led much of the field to be populated by research programs that provide intricate theories of psychological mechanism but that have little (or unknown) ability to predict future behaviors with any appreciable accuracy. We propose that principles and techniques from the field of machine learning can help psychology become a more predictive science. We review some of the fundamental concepts and tools of machine learning and point out examples where these concepts have been used to conduct interesting and important psychological research that focuses on predictive research questions. We suggest that an increased focus on prediction, rather than explanation, can ultimately lead us to greater understanding of behavior.},

Following nocodazole treatment, hPSCs remain pluripotent, retain a normal karyotype and can successfully differentiate into the three germ layers and functional cell types. Moreover, genome-wide transcriptomic analyses on single cells synchronized for their cell cycle and differentiated toward the endoderm lineage validated our findings and showed that nocodazole treatment has no effect on gene expression during the differentiation process. Thus, our synchronization method provides a robust approach to study cell cycle mechanisms in hPSCs.},

In most regions, neuronal migratory profiles are speculated similar based on observations using thymidine analogs. Few reports have investigated regional migratory differences from mitosis at the ventricular surface. In this study, we applied FlashTag technology, in which dyes are injected intraventricularly, to describe migratory profiles. We revealed a mediolateral regional difference in the migratory profiles of neurons that is dependent on developmental stage; for example, neurons labeled at embryonic day 12.5\textendash 15.5 reached their destination earlier dorsomedially than dorsolaterally, even where there were underlying ventricular surfaces, reflecting sojourning below the subplate. This difference was hardly recapitulated by thymidine analogs, which visualize neurogenic gradients, suggesting a biological significance different from the neurogenic gradient. These observations advance our understanding of cortical development and the power of FlashTag in studying migration and are thus resources for future neurodevelopmental studies.},

Similarly, high affinity is routinely the goal for therapeutic antibody generation. However, in contrast to naturally occurring or direct-targeting therapeutic antibodies, immunomodulatory antibodies, which are designed to modulate receptor signalling, have not been widely examined for their affinity\textendash function relationship. Here we examine three separate immunologically important receptors spanning two receptor superfamilies: CD40, 4-1BB and PD-1. We show that low rather than high affinity delivers greater activity through increased clustering. This approach delivered higher immune cell activation, in vivo T\,cell expansion and antitumour activity in the case of CD40. Moreover, an inert anti-4-1BB monoclonal antibody was transformed into an agonist. Low-affinity variants of the clinically important antagonistic anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody nivolumab also mediated more potent signalling and affected T\,cell activation. These findings reveal a new paradigm for augmenting agonism across diverse receptor families and shed light on the mechanism of antibody-mediated receptor signalling. Such affinity engineering offers a rational, efficient and highly tuneable solution to deliver antibody-mediated receptor activity across a range of potencies suitable for translation to the treatment of human disease.},

  abstract = {To understand the function of cortical circuits, it is necessary to catalog their cellular diversity. Past attempts to do so using anatomical, physiological or molecular features of cortical cells have not resulted in a unified taxonomy of neuronal or glial cell types, partly due to limited data. Single-cell transcriptomics is enabling, for the first time, systematic high-throughput measurements of cortical cells and generation of datasets that hold the promise of being complete, accurate and permanent. Statistical analyses of these data reveal clusters that often correspond to cell types previously defined by morphological or physiological criteria and that appear conserved across cortical areas and species. To capitalize on these new methods, we propose the adoption of a transcriptome-based taxonomy of cell types for mammalian neocortex. This classification should be hierarchical and use a standardized nomenclature. It should be based on a probabilistic definition of a cell type and incorporate data from different approaches, developmental stages and species. A community-based classification and data aggregation model, such as a knowledge graph, could provide a common foundation for the study of cortical circuits. This community-based classification, nomenclature and data aggregation could serve as an example for cell type atlases in other parts of the body.},

We computationally identify all major cortical cell types, including the embryonic radial precursors (RPs) that generate adult NSCs. We define the initial emergence of RPs from neuroepithelial stem cells at E11.5. We show that, by E13.5, RPs express a transcriptional identity that is maintained and reinforced throughout their transition to a non-proliferative state between E15.5 and E17.5. These slowly proliferating late embryonic RPs share a core transcriptional phenotype with quiescent adult forebrain NSCs. Together, these findings support a model wherein cortical RPs maintain a core transcriptional identity from embryogenesis through to adulthood and wherein the transition to a quiescent adult NSC occurs during late neurogenesis.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We applied information theory to quantify the asymmetric information transfer between pairs of cells and defined quantitative measures to how single cells receive or transmit information within a multicellular network. Our analysis revealed that multicellular synchronization was established by gradual enhancement of information spread from the single cell to the multicellular scale. Synchronization was associated with heterogeneity in the cells' communication properties, reinforcement of the cells' state, and information flow. Altogether, we suggest a phenomenological model where cells gradually learn their local environment, adjust, and reinforce their internal state to stabilize the multicellular network architecture to support information flow from local to global scales toward multicellular synchronization.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Cell cycle kinetics are crucial to cell fate decisions. Although live imaging has provided extensive insights into this relationship at the single-cell level, the limited number of fluorescent markers that can~be used in a single experiment has hindered efforts to link the dynamics of individual proteins responsible for decision making directly to cell cycle~progression. Here, we present fluorescently tagged~endogenous proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) as an all-in-one cell cycle reporter that allows simultaneous analysis of cell cycle progression, including the transition into quiescence, and the dynamics of individual fate determinants. We also provide an image analysis pipeline for automated segmentation, tracking, and classification of all cell cycle phases. Combining the all-in-one reporter with labeled endogenous cyclin D1 and p21 as prime examples of cell-cycle-regulated fate determinants, we show how cell cycle and quantitative protein dynamics can be simultaneously extracted to gain insights into G1 phase regulation and responses to perturbations.},

  abstract = {Beyond transferring genetic information, RNAs are molecules with diverse functions that include catalyzing biochemical reactions and regulating gene expression. Most of these activities depend on RNAs' specific structures. Therefore, accurately determining RNA structure is integral to advancing our understanding of RNA functions. Here, we summarize the state-of-the-art experimental and computational technologies developed to evaluate RNA secondary and tertiary structures. We also highlight how the rapid increase of experimental data facilitates the integrative modeling approaches for better resolving RNA structures. Finally, we provide our thoughts on the latest advances and challenges in RNA structure determination methods, as well as on future directions for both experimental approaches and artificial intelligence-based computational tools to model RNA structure. Ultimately, we hope the technological advances will deepen our understanding of RNA biology and facilitate RNA structure-based biomedical research such as designing specific RNA structures for therapeutics and deploying RNA-targeting small-molecule drugs.},

In developmental biology and stem cell studies, the ability to profile single cells confers particular benefits. Although most studies still focus on individual tissues or organs, the recent development of ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq has demonstrated potential power in characterizing more complex systems or even the entire body. However, although multiple ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq systems have attracted attention, no systematic comparison of these systems has been performed. Here, with the same cell line and bioinformatics pipeline, we developed directly comparable datasets for each of three widely used droplet-based ultra-high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq systems, inDrop, Drop-seq, and 10X Genomics Chromium. Although each system is capable of profiling single-cell transcriptomes, their detailed comparison revealed the distinguishing features and suitable applications for each system.},

  abstract = {The ``click chemistry'' approach utilizing 5-ethynyl-2{${'}$}-deoxyuridine (EdU) as a DNA precursor was recently introduced to assess DNA replication and adapted to flow- and imaging-cytometry. In the present study, we observed that EdU, once incorporated into DNA, induces DNA damage signaling (DDS) such as phosphorylation of ATM on Ser1981, of histone H2AX on Ser139, of p53 on Ser15, and of Chk2 on Thr68. It also perturbs progression of cells through the cell cycle and subsequently induces apoptosis. These effects were observed in non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma A549 as well as in B-cell human lymphoblastoid TK6 and WTK1 cells, differing in the status of p53 (wt versus mutated). After 1 h EdU pulse-labeling, the most affected was cells progression through the S phase subsequent to that at which they had incorporated EdU. This indicates that DNA replication using the template containing incorporated EdU is protracted and triggers DDS. Furthermore, progression of cells having DNA pulse-labeled with EdU led to accumulation of cells in G2, likely by activating G2 checkpoint. Consistent with the latter was activation of p53 and Chk2. Although a correlation was observed in A549 cells between the degree of EdU incorporation and the extent of {$\gamma$}H2AX induction, such correlation was weak in TK6 and WTK1 cells. The degree of perturbation of the cell cycle kinetics by the incorporated EdU was different in the wt p53 TK6 cells as compared to their sister WTK1 cell line having mutated p53. The data are thus consistent with the role of p53 in modulating activation of cell cycle checkpoints in response to impaired DNA replication. The confocal microscopy analysis of the 3D images of cells exposed to EdU for 1 h pulse and then grown for 24 or 48 h revealed an increased number of colocalized {$\gamma$}H2AX and p53BP1 foci considered to be markers of DNA double-strand breaks and enlarged nuclei. \textcopyright{} 2013 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},

Designing synthetic multistable circuits would provide insight into natural cell fate control circuit architectures and would allow engineering of multicellular programs that require interactions among distinct cell types. We created MultiFate, a naturally inspired, synthetic circuit that supports long-term, controllable, and expandable multistability in mammalian cells. MultiFate uses engineered zinc finger transcription factors that transcriptionally self-activate as homodimers and mutually inhibit one another through heterodimerization. Using a model-based design, we engineered MultiFate circuits that generate as many as seven states, each stable for at least 18 days. MultiFate permits controlled state switching and modulation of state stability through external inputs and can be expanded with additional transcription factors. These results provide a foundation for engineering multicellular behaviors in mammalian cells.},

  abstract = {Cell cycle is a biological process underlying the existence and propagation of life in time and space. It has been an object for mathematical modeling for long, with several alternative mechanistic modeling principles suggested, describing in more or less details the known molecular mechanisms. Recently, cell cycle has been investigated at single cell level in snapshots of unsynchronized cell populations, exploiting the new methods for transcriptomic and proteomic molecular profiling. This raises a need for simplified semi-phenomenological cell cycle models, in order to formalize the processes underlying the cell cycle, at a higher abstracted level. Here we suggest a modeling framework, recapitulating the most important properties of the cell cycle as a limit trajectory of a dynamical process characterized by several internal states with switches between them. In the simplest form, this leads to a limit cycle trajectory, composed by linear segments in logarithmic coordinates describing some extensive (depending on system size) cell properties. We prove a theorem connecting the effective embedding dimensionality of the cell cycle trajectory with the number of its linear segments. We also develop a simplified kinetic model with piecewise-constant kinetic rates describing the dynamics of lumps of genes involved in S-phase and G2/M phases. We show how the developed cell cycle models can be applied to analyze the available single cell datasets and simulate certain properties of the observed cell cycle trajectories. Based on our model, we can predict with good accuracy the cell line doubling time from the length of cell cycle trajectory.},

  abstract = {Recent advances allowing quantification of RNA from single cells are revolutionizing biology and medicine. Currently, almost all single-cell transcriptomic protocols rely on reverse transcription (RT). However, RT is recognized as a known source of variability, particularly with low amounts of RNA. Recently, several new reverse transcriptases (RTases) with the potential to decrease the loss of information have been developed, but knowledge of their performance is limited.We compared the performance of 11 RTases in quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) on single-cell and 100-cell bulk templates, using 2 priming strategies: a conventional mixture of random hexamers with oligo(dT)s and a reduced concentration of oligo(dT)s mimicking common single-cell RNA-sequencing protocols. Depending on their performance, 2 RTases were further tested in a high-throughput single-cell experiment.All tested RTases demonstrated high precision (R2 \&gt; 0.9445). The most pronounced differences were found in their ability to capture rare transcripts (0\%\textendash 90\% reaction positivity rate) and in their absolute reaction yield (7.3\%\textendash 137.9\%). RTase performance and reproducibility were compared with Z scores. The 2 best-performing enzymes were Maxima H- and SuperScript IV. The validity of the obtained results was confirmed in a follow-up single-cell model experiment. The better-performing enzyme (Maxima H-) increased the sensitivity of the single-cell experiment and improved resolution in the clustering analysis over the commonly used RTase (SuperScript II).Our comprehensive comparison of 11 RTases in low RNA input conditions identified 2 best-performing enzymes. Our results provide a point of reference for the improvement of current single-cell quantification protocols.}
