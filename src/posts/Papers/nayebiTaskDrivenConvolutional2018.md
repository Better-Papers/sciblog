- Search over thousands of models that varied in their locally recurrent and long-range feedback connections
- Successful models exclusively used depth-separable convolutions for their local recurrent connections.
- ConvRNNs optimized for the ImageNet task strongly predicted neural dynamics in macaque V4 and IT from electrode array.

- ConvRNN predictions have dynamic trajectories that resemble smoothed versions of the ground truth responses, whereas feedforward predictions necessarily have the same time course for every image.
