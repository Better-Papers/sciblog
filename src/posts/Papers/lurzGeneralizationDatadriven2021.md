- introduce a novel readout mechanism that keeps the number of per-neuron parameters at a minimum and learns a bivariate Gaussian distribution for the readout position from anatomical data using retinotopy.
- this generalization can be attributed to the *representation* and not the readout mechanism

- 4-layer CNN 64 channels/layer. Batch norm every layer => ELU. All convolutional layers after the first one are depth-separable convolutions
