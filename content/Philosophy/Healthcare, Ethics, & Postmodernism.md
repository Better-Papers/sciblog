## Principle of Voluntary Responsibility

- Jeff McMahan
- If you make a voluntary decision that put other people in harm's way, you are responsible for it.
- Dan Wikler: logical requirement: need to exhaust all 'nonvoluntary' cases before start treating 'voluntary' cases.  
  - Every single case of STDs or pregnancy must be relegated.
  - Every case of suicide attempts.
  - Even cases of food poisoning.
- How do we tell how responsible people are for their health?

> Subjects were significantly less willing to distribute organs to [IV] drug users than to cigarette smokers or people eating high fat diets, even when intravenous drug users had better transplant outcomes than other patients.
>
> Subjects' allocation decisions were influenced by transplant prognosis, but **not** by whether the behavior in question was causally responsible for the patients' organ failure. ... Many people believe that such patients are simply less worthy of transplant organs. ... These arguments may be convenient ways to support what otherwise merely reflect social desirability judgments.
>
> _Ubel, Baron, and Asch, “Social Responsibility, Personal Responsibility, and Prognosis in Public Judgements About Transplant Allocation,” in Bioethics_

### Foucault

- Political power used to control the bodies of individual people.
- Now control groups of people: _biopolitics_.  
  - Public vaccination programmes. Abortion bans.
- Power is never neutral. No political decision can be biased.
- Any appeal to facts presumes a certain context in which those facts matter.

### Neoliberalism

- Choice as free market.

> Neoliberalism ascribes virtually all responsibility for personal and social welfare to the individual, which is further articulated as crucial to individual liberty under the auspices of choice.
>
> This choice is tightly linked with consumption... Exercising their choice is tantamount to democracy. ... Government intervention at any level - in the form of social services ... - is represented as cultivating and enabling independence and, more to the point, undemocratic.
>
> _Helene Shugart, Heavy_

There is not really a discussion of the Principle of Voluntary Responsibility to the full extent. We could afford to look after everybody. It's not a problem of not having enough resources. We don't do it because we choose not to, and the same is true of healthcare. Limited resources are often limited artificially for other priorities, such as lower corporate taxes. This is a problem of choice, not scarcity.
