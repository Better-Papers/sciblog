# Graph Theory

```{definition, simgraph, name="undirected graph"}
In a simple graph, the graph is undirected, no loops, no weights and is defined by
$$
  G(V, E, w)
$$
where $V$ is a set of vertices and E is a set of two-sets (sets with two distinct elements) of vertices, whose elements are called edges, and $w$ is a function $w: E \rightarrow \mathcal{R}^+$.
```



```{definition, adj, name="adjacency matrix"}
An adjacency matrix describes the connections within the graph.
$$
  A (i,j) = \begin{cases}
     w(i,j) & (i,j) \in E \\
     0 & \text{otherwise}
     \end{cases}
$$
The matrix is hollow, since there's no self-loop.
```

```{definition, deg, name="degree matrix"}
$$
  D = \mathrm{diag} \pp{\sum_j A(i,j)}
$$
```

```{definition, laplacian, name="Laplacian matrix"}
In a simple graph, the Laplacian matrix is an $|V| \times |V|$ matrix defined as
$$
  L = D-A
$$
where $D$ is the degree matrix and $A$ is the adjacency matrix of the graph.

Let $A_i$ be the column of an adjacency matrix, then
$$
  L = \sum_{(i,j)\in E} (A_i - A_j)(A_i - A_j)^\top
$$
That is, summing over all columns of each edge elements.
```

As an example, consider a simple graph with two vertices and one edge. Then

$$
\begin{align}
  G &= (V, E) \\
  V &= \{v_1, v_2 \} \\
  E &= \{ \{v_1,v_2\} \} \\
  \\
  D &= I_2 \\
  A &= \begin{bmatrix}
  0 & 1 \\
  1 & 0
  \end{bmatrix} \\
  L &= \begin{bmatrix}
  1 & -1 \\
  -1 & 1
  \end{bmatrix} \\
\end{align}
$$
Note that for any vector $\b{x} \in \mathbb{R}^2$
$$
  \b{x}^\top L \b{x} = (x_1 - x_2)^2
$$
