  abstract = {Optogenetics ushered in a revolution in how neuroscientists interrogate brain function. Because of technical limitations, the majority of optogenetic studies have used low spatial resolution activation schemes that limit the types of perturbations that can be made. However, neural activity manipulations at finer spatial scales are likely to be important to more fully understand neural computation. Spatially precise multiphoton holographic optogenetics promises to address this challenge and opens up many new classes of experiments that were not previously possible. More specifically, by offering the ability to recreate extremely specific neural activity patterns in both space and time in functionally defined ensembles of neurons, multiphoton holographic optogenetics could allow neuroscientists to reveal fundamental aspects of the neural codes for sensation, cognition and behavior that have been beyond reach. This Review summarizes recent advances in multiphoton holographic optogenetics that substantially expand its capabilities, highlights outstanding technical challenges and provides an overview of the classes of experiments it can execute to test and validate key theoretical models of brain function. Multiphoton holographic optogenetics could substantially accelerate the pace of neuroscience discovery by helping to close the loop between experimental and theoretical neuroscience, leading to fundamental new insights into nervous system function and disorder.},

  abstract = {Current-clamp recordings were made from the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) of 12- to 15-day-old rats to understand the factors that mediate intrinsic spontaneous firing patterns. All of the cells recorded were spontaneously active with spiking patterns ranging continuously from regular spiking to spontaneous bursting with the former predominating. A robust rebound depolarization (RD) leading to a Na+ spike burst was elicited after the offset of hyperpolarizing current injection. The voltage and time dependence of the RD was consistent with mediation by low-threshold voltage-gated Ca2+channels. In addition, induction of a RD also may be affected by activation of a hyperpolarization-activated cation current,Ih. A RD could be evoked efficiently after brief high-frequency bursts of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) induced by stimulation of Purkinje cell axons. IPSP-driven RDs were typically much larger and longer than those elicited by direct hyperpolarizing pulses of approximately matched amplitude and duration. Intracellular perfusion of the Ca2+ buffer bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-N,N,N{${'}$},N{${'}$}-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) dramatically enhanced the RD and its associated spiking, sometimes leading to a plateau potential that lasted several hundred milliseconds. The effects of BAPTA could be mimicked partly by application of apamin, a blocker of small conductance Ca2+-gated K+ channels, but not by paxilline, which blocks large conductance Ca2+-gated K+channels. Application of both BAPTA and apamin, but not paxilline, caused cells that were regularly spiking to burst spontaneously. Taken together, our data suggest that there is a strong relationship between the ability of DCN cells to elicit a RD and their tendency burst spontaneously. The RD can be triggered by the opening of T-type Ca2+ channels with an additional contribution of hyperpolarization-activated current Ih. RD duration is regulated by small-conductance Ca2+-gated K+ channels. The RD also is modulated tonically by inhibitory inputs. All of these factors are in turn subject to alteration by extrinsic modulatory neurotransmitters and are, at least in part, responsible for determining the firing modes of DCN neurons.}

  abstract = {Background Astrocytes, also called astroglia, maintain homoeostasis of the brain by providing trophic and metabolic support to neurons. They recycle neurotransmitters, stimulate synaptogenesis and synaptic neurotransmission, form part of the blood\textendash brain barrier, and regulate regional blood flow. Although astrocytes have been known to display morphological alterations in Alzheimer's disease for more than a century, research has remained neurocentric. Emerging evidence suggests that these morphological changes reflect functional alterations that affect disease. Recent developments Genetic studies indicate that most of the risk of developing late onset Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of the disease, affecting patients aged 65 years and older, is associated with genes (ie, APOE, APOJ, and SORL) that are mainly expressed by glial cells (ie, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes). This insight has moved the focus of research away from neurons and towards glial cells and neuroinflammation. Molecular studies in rodent models suggest a direct contribution of astrocytes to neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes causing Alzheimer's disease; however, these models might insufficiently mimic the human disease, because rodent astrocytes differ considerably in morphology, functionality, and gene expression. In-vivo studies using stem-cell derived human astrocytes are allowing exploration of the human disease and providing insights into the neurotoxic or protective contributions of these cells to the pathogenesis of disease. The first attempts to develop astrocytic biomarkers and targeted therapies are emerging. Where next? Single-cell transcriptomics allows the fate of individual astrocytes to be followed in situ and provides the granularity needed to describe healthy and pathological cellular states at different stages of Alzheimer's disease. Given the differences between human and rodent astroglia, study of human cells in this way will be crucial. Although refined single-cell transcriptomic analyses of human post-mortem brains are important for documentation of pathology, they only provide snapshots of a dynamic reality. Thus, functional work studying human astrocytes generated from stem cells and exposed to pathological conditions in rodent brain or cell culture are needed to understand the role of these cells in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. These studies will lead to novel biomarkers and hopefully a series of new drug targets to tackle this disease.},

How this intrinsically generated activity influences development remains uncertain, because few mechanistic studies have been performed in~vivo. We show using macroscopic calcium imaging in unanesthetized mice that neurons responsible for processing similar frequencies of sound exhibit highly synchronized activity throughout the auditory system during this critical phase of development. Spontaneous activity normally requires synaptic excitation of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). Unexpectedly, tonotopic spontaneous activity was preserved in a mouse model of deafness in which glutamate release from hair cells is abolished. SGNs in these mice exhibited enhanced excitability, enabling direct neuronal excitation by supporting cell-induced potassium transients. These results indicate that homeostatic mechanisms maintain spontaneous activity in the pre-hearing period, with significant implications for both circuit development and therapeutic approaches aimed at treating congenital forms of deafness arising through mutations in key sensory transduction components.},

We tested an alternative strategy in which shapes were traced on the surface of visual cortex by stimulating electrodes in dynamic sequence. In both sighted and blind participants, dynamic stimulation enabled accurate recognition of letter shapes predicted by the brain's spatial map of the visual world. Forms were presented and recognized rapidly by blind participants, up to 86 forms per minute. These findings demonstrate that a brain prosthetic can produce coherent percepts of visual forms.},

Both variants have identical network connectivity and were compared to each other and to experimental recordings of visual-driven neural activity. While tuning these networks to recapitulate experimental data, we identified rules governing cell-class-specific connectivity and synaptic strengths. These structural constraints constitute hypotheses that can be tested experimentally. Despite their distinct single-cell abstraction, both spatially extended and point models perform similarly at the level of firing rate distributions for the questions we investigated.

  abstract = {A cornerstone of theoretical neuroscience is the circuit model: a system of equations that captures a hypothesized neural mechanism. Such models are valuable when they give rise to an experimentally observed phenomenon -- whether behavioral or a pattern of neural activity -- and thus can offer insights into neural computation. The operation of these circuits, like all models, critically depends on the choice of model parameters. A key step is then to identify the model parameters consistent with observed phenomena: to solve the inverse problem. In this work, we present a novel technique, emergent property inference (EPI), that brings the modern probabilistic modeling toolkit to theoretical neuroscience. When theorizing circuit models, theoreticians predominantly focus on reproducing computational properties rather than a particular dataset. Our method uses deep neural networks to learn parameter distributions with these computational properties. This methodology is introduced through a motivational example of parameter inference in the stomatogastric ganglion. EPI is then shown to allow precise control over the behavior of inferred parameters and to scale in parameter dimension better than alternative techniques. In the remainder of this work, we present novel theoretical findings in models of primary visual cortex and superior colliculus, which were gained through the examination of complex parametric structure captured by EPI. Beyond its scientific contribution, this work illustrates the variety of analyses possible once deep learning is harnessed towards solving theoretical inverse problems.},

Here we assess the effect of this flexibility on the results of functional magnetic resonance imaging~by asking 70 independent teams to analyse the same dataset, testing the same 9 ex-ante hypotheses1. The flexibility of analytical approaches is exemplified by the fact that no two teams chose identical workflows to analyse the data. This flexibility resulted in sizeable variation in the results of hypothesis tests, even for teams whose statistical maps were highly correlated at intermediate stages of the analysis pipeline. Variation in reported results was related to several aspects of analysis methodology. Notably, a meta-analytical approach that aggregated information across teams yielded a significant consensus in activated regions. Furthermore, prediction markets of researchers in the field revealed an overestimation of the likelihood of significant findings, even by researchers with direct knowledge of the dataset2\textendash 5. Our findings show that analytical flexibility can have substantial effects on scientific conclusions, and identify factors that may be related to variability in the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging. The results emphasize the importance of validating and sharing complex analysis workflows, and demonstrate the need for performing and reporting multiple analyses of the same data. Potential approaches that could be used to mitigate issues related to analytical variability are discussed.},

Each published experiment becomes a historical document; it relies on past research (the ``Introduction'' section), procedures developed in the past (``Methods'' section) and as soon as new data are published, they become history and become embedded into the history of the discipline (``Discussion'' section). In order to be transparent and able to be replicated, each experiment requires its own historical archive. Studying history means researching books, documents and objects in libraries, archives, and museums. It means looking at data books, letters and memos, talking to scientists, and reading biographies and autobiographies. History can be made relevant by integrating historical documents into classes and by using historical websites. Finally, conducting historical research can be interesting, entertaining, and can lead to travel to out-of-the-way and exotic places and meeting interesting people.},

  abstract = {Metabolic disorders, particularly aberrations in lipid homeostasis, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertriglyceridemia often manifest together as the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Despite major advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of these disorders, the prevalence of the MetS continues to rise. It is becoming increasingly apparent that intermediary metabolism within the central nervous system is a major contributor to the regulation of systemic metabolism. In particular, lipid metabolism within the brain is tightly regulated to maintain neuronal structure and function and may signal nutrient status to modulate metabolism in key peripheral tissues such as the liver. There is now a growing body of evidence to suggest that fatty acid (FA) sensing in hypothalamic neurons via accumulation of FAs or FA metabolites may signal nutritional sufficiency and may decrease hepatic glucose production, lipogenesis, and VLDL-TG secretion. In addition, recent studies have highlighted the existence of liver-related neurons that have the potential to direct such signals through parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system activity. However, to date whether these liver-related neurons are FA sensitive remain to be determined. The findings discussed in this review underscore the importance of the autonomic nervous system in the regulation of systemic metabolism and highlight the need for further research to determine the key features of FA neurons, which may serve as novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of metabolic disorders.},

  abstract = {Despite the recent success of neural network models in mimicking animal performance on visual perceptual tasks, critics worry that these models fail to illuminate brain function. We take it that a central approach to explanation in systems neuroscience is that of mechanistic modeling, where understanding the system is taken to require fleshing out the parts, organization, and activities of a system, and how those give rise to behaviors of interest. However, it remains somewhat controversial what it means for a model to describe a mechanism, and whether neural network models qualify as explanatory. We argue that certain kinds of neural network models are actually good examples of mechanistic models, when the right notion of mechanistic mapping is deployed. Building on existing work on model-to-mechanism mapping (3M), we describe criteria delineating such a notion, which we call 3M++. These criteria require us, first, to identify a level of description that is both abstract but detailed enough to be "runnable", and then, to construct model-to-brain mappings using the same principles as those employed for brain-to-brain mapping across individuals. Perhaps surprisingly, the abstractions required are those already in use in experimental neuroscience, and are of the kind deployed in the construction of more familiar computational models, just as the principles of inter-brain mappings are very much in the spirit of those already employed in the collection and analysis of data across animals. In a companion paper, we address the relationship between optimization and intelligibility, in the context of functional evolutionary explanations. Taken together, mechanistic interpretations of computational models and the dependencies between form and function illuminated by optimization processes can help us to understand why brain systems are built they way they are.},

  abstract = {Neural processing occurs across a range of temporal scales. To facilitate this, the brain uses fast-changing representations reflecting momentary sensory input alongside more temporally extended representations, which integrate across both short and long temporal windows. The temporal flexibility of these representations allows animals to behave adaptively. Short temporal windows facilitate adaptive responding in dynamic environments, while longer temporal windows promote the gradual integration of information across time. In the cognitive and motor domains, the brain sets overarching goals to be achieved within a long temporal window, which must be broken down into sequences of actions and precise movement control processed across much shorter temporal windows. Previous human neuroimaging studies and large-scale artificial network models have ascribed different processing timescales to different cortical regions, linking this to each region's position in an anatomical hierarchy determined by patterns of inter-regional connectivity. However, even within cortical regions, there is variability in responses when studied with single-neuron electrophysiology. Here, we review a series of recent electrophysiology experiments that demonstrate the heterogeneity of temporal receptive fields at the level of single neurons within a cortical region. This heterogeneity appears functionally relevant for the computations that neurons perform during decision-making and working memory. We consider anatomical and biophysical mechanisms that may give rise to a heterogeneity of timescales, including recurrent connectivity, cortical layer distribution, and neurotransmitter receptor expression. Finally, we reflect on the computational relevance of each brain region possessing a heterogeneity of neuronal timescales. We argue that this architecture is of particular importance for sensory, motor, and cognitive computations.}

It is often assumed that signal receivers perceive and respond continuously to continuous variation in the signal2. Alternatively, perception and response may be discontinuous3, owing to limitations in discrimination, categorization or both. Discrimination is the ability to tell two stimuli apart (for example, whether one can tell apart colours close to each other in hue). Categorization concerns whether stimuli are grouped based on similarities (for example, identifying colours with qualitative similarities in hue as similar even if they can be distinguished)4. Categorical perception is a mechanism by which perceptual systems categorize continuously varying stimuli, making specific predictions about discrimination relative to category boundaries. Here we show that female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) categorically perceive a continuously variable assessment signal: the orange to red spectrum of male beak colour. Both predictions of categorical perception5 were supported: females (1) categorized colour stimuli that varied along a continuum and (2) showed increased discrimination between colours from opposite sides of a category boundary compared to equally different colours from within a category. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of categorical perception of signal-based colouration in a bird, with implications for understanding avian colour perception and signal evolution in general.},

Unbiased evaluation of actively translated RNA and proteomic data confirmed significant astrocyte diversity between hippocampal and striatal circuits.

  abstract = {Visual selective attention is the brain function that modulates ongoing processing of retinal input in order for selected representations to gain privileged access to perceptual awareness and guide behavior. Enhanced analysis of currently relevant or otherwise salient information is often accompanied by suppressed processing of the less relevant or salient input. Recent findings indicate that rewards exert a powerful influence on the deployment of visual selective attention. Such influence takes different forms depending on the specific protocol adopted in the given study. In some cases, the prospect of earning a larger reward in relation to a specific stimulus or location biases attention accordingly in order to maximize overall gain. This is mediated by an effect of reward acting as a type of incentive motivation for the strategic control of attention. In contrast, reward delivery can directly alter the processing of specific stimuli by increasing their attentional priority, and this can be measured even when rewards are no longer involved, reflecting a form of reward-mediated attentional learning. As a further development, recent work demonstrates that rewards can affect attentional learning in dissociable ways depending on whether rewards are perceived as feedback on performance or instead are registered as random-like events occurring during task performance. Specifically, it appears that visual selective attention is shaped by two distinct reward-related learning mechanisms: one requiring active monitoring of performance and outcome, and a second one detecting the sheer association between objects in the environment (whether attended or ignored) and the more-or-less rewarding events that accompany them. Overall this emerging literature demonstrates unequivocally that rewards ``teach'' visual selective attention so that processing resources will be allocated to objects, features and locations which are likely to optimize the organism's interaction with the surrounding environment and maximize positive outcome.},

We identified neurons tuned to each stimulus type and motor output and discovered groups of neurons in the anterior hindbrain that respond to different stimuli eliciting similar behavioral responses. These convergent sensorimotor representations were only weakly correlated to instantaneous motor activity, suggesting that they critically inform, but do not directly generate, behavioral choices. To catalog brain-wide activity beyond explicit sensorimotor processing, we developed an unsupervised clustering technique that organizes neurons into functional groups. These analyses enabled a broad overview of the functional organization of the brain and revealed numerous brain nuclei whose neurons exhibit concerted activity patterns.},

Best characterized in the visual domain, it is typically depicted as a spotlight moving over a saliency map that topographically encodes strengths of visual features and feedback modulations over the visual scene. By introducing smells to two well-established attentional paradigms, the dot-probe and the visual-search paradigms, we find that a smell reflexively directs attention to the congruent visual image and facilitates visual search of that image without the mediation of visual imagery. Furthermore, such effect is independent of, and can override, top-down bias. We thus propose that smell quality acts as an object feature whose presence enhances the perceptual saliency of that object, thereby guiding the spotlight of visual attention. Our discoveries provide robust empirical evidence for a multimodal saliency map that weighs not only visual but also olfactory inputs.},

Such models provide a means for comprehensive data integration, can be experimentally validated, are readily interpreted both biologically and clinically, and have the potential to predict effective therapies for different cancer types and subtypes. We explain what executable models are and how they can be used to represent the dynamic biological behaviours inherent in cancer, and demonstrate how such models, when coupled with automated reasoning, facilitate our understanding of the mechanisms by which oncogenic signalling pathways regulate tumours. We explore how executable models have impacted the field of cancer research and argue that extending them to represent a tumour in a specific patient (that is, an avatar) will pave the way for improved personalized treatments and precision medicine.

As with these other systems, this representation is not accurate per se, but is constructed for utility, and emphasizes certain, presumably useful, features over others. I here describe the cellular and circuit mechanisms of the peripheral olfactory system that underlie this process of sensory construction, emphasizing the distinct architectures and properties of the two prominent computational layers in the olfactory bulb. Notably, while the olfactory system solves essentially similar conceptual problems to other sensory systems, such as contrast enhancement, activity normalization, and extending dynamic range, its peculiarities often require qualitatively different computational algorithms than are deployed in other sensory modalities. In particular, the olfactory modality is intrinsically high dimensional, and lacks a simple, externally defined basis analogous to wavelength or pitch on which elemental odor stimuli can be quantitatively compared. Accordingly, the quantitative similarities of the receptive fields of different odorant receptors (ORs) vary according to the statistics of the odor environment. To resolve these unusual challenges, the olfactory bulb appears to utilize unique nontopographical computations and intrinsic learning mechanisms to perform the necessary high-dimensional, similarity-dependent computations. In sum, the early olfactory system implements a coordinated set of early sensory transformations directly analogous to those in other sensory systems, but accomplishes these with unique circuit architectures adapted to the properties of the olfactory modality.},

  abstract = {The internal brain dynamics that link sensation and action are arguably better studied during natural animal behaviors. Here, we report on a novel volume imaging and 3D tracking technique that monitors whole brain neural activity in freely swimming larval zebrafish (Danio rerio). We demonstrated the capability of our system through functional imaging of neural activity during visually evoked and prey capture behaviors in larval zebrafish., How do neurons in the brain process information from the senses and drive complex behaviors? This question has fascinated neuroscientists for many years. It is currently not possible to record the electrical activities of all of the 100 billion neurons in a human brain. Yet, in the last decade, it has become possible to genetically engineer some neurons in animals to produce fluorescence reporters that change their brightness in response to brain activity and then monitor them under a microscope. In small animals such as zebrafish larvae, this method makes it possible to monitor the activities of all the neurons in the brain if the animal's head is held still. However, many behaviors \textendash{} for example, catching prey \textendash{} require movement, and no existing technique could image brain activity in enough detail if the animal's head was moving., Cong, Wang, Chai, Hang et al. have now made progress towards this goal by developing a new technique to image neural activity across the whole brain of a zebrafish larva as it swims freely in a small water-filled chamber. The technique uses high-speed cameras and computer software to track the movements of the fish in three dimensions, and then automatically moves the chamber under the microscope such that the animal's brain is constantly kept in focus. The newly developed microscope can capture changes in neural activity across a large volume all at the same time. It is then further adapted to overcome problems caused by sudden or swift movements, which would normally result in motion blur. With this microscope set up, Cong et al. were able to capture, for the first time, activity from all the neurons in a zebrafish larva's brain as it pursued and caught its prey., This technique provides a new window into how brain activity changes when animals are behaving naturally. In the future, this technique could help link the activities of neurons to different behaviors in several popular model organisms including fish, worms and fruit flies.},

Here we address the neural basis for color, using targeted single-unit recording in alert macaque monkeys, guided by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the same subjects. Distributed within posterior inferior temporal cortex, a large region encompassing V4, PITd, and posterior TEO that some have proposed functions as a single visual complex, we found color-biased fMRI hotspots that we call "globs," each several millimeters wide. Almost all cells located in globs showed strong luminance-invariant color tuning and some shape selectivity. Cells in different globs represented distinct visual field locations, consistent with the coarse retinotopy of this brain region. Cells in "interglob" regions were not color tuned, but were more strongly shape selective. Neither population was direction selective. These results suggest that color perception is mediated by specialized neurons that are clustered within the extrastriate brain.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {One of the most challenging tasks in modern science is the development of systems biology models: Existing models are often very complex but generally have low predictive performance. The construction of high-fidelity models will require hundreds/thousands of cycles of model improvement, yet few current systems biology research studies complete even a single cycle. We combined multiple software tools with integrated laboratory robotics to execute three cycles of model improvement of the prototypical eukaryotic cellular transformation, the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) diauxic shift. In the first cycle, a model outperforming the best previous diauxic shift model was developed using bioinformatic and systems biology tools. In the second cycle, the model was further improved using automatically planned experiments. In the third cycle, hypothesis-led experiments improved the model to a greater extent than achieved using high-throughput experiments. All of the experiments were formalized and communicated to a cloud laboratory automation system (Eve) for automatic execution, and the results stored on the semantic web for reuse. The final model adds a substantial amount of knowledge about the yeast diauxic shift: 92 genes (+45\%), and 1,048 interactions (+147\%). This knowledge is also relevant to understanding cancer, the immune system, and aging. We conclude that systems biology software tools can be combined and integrated with laboratory robots in closed-loop cycles.},

  abstract = {Deep artificial neural networks apply principles of the brain's information processing that led to breakthroughs in machine learning spanning many problem domains. Neuromorphic computing aims to take this a step further to chips more directly inspired by the form and function of biological neural circuits, so they can process new knowledge, adapt, behave, and learn in real time at low power levels. Despite several decades of research, until recently, very few published results have shown that today's neuromorphic chips can demonstrate quantitative computational value. This is now changing with the advent of Intel's Loihi, a neuromorphic research processor designed to support a broad range of spiking neural networks with sufficient scale, performance, and features to deliver competitive results compared to state-of-the-art contemporary computing architectures. This survey reviews results that are obtained to date with Loihi across the major algorithmic domains under study, including deep learning approaches and novel approaches that aim to more directly harness the key features of spike-based neuromorphic hardware. While conventional feedforward deep neural networks show modest if any benefit on Loihi, more brain-inspired networks using recurrence, precise spike-timing relationships, synaptic plasticity, stochasticity, and sparsity perform certain computation with orders of magnitude lower latency and energy compared to state-of-the-art conventional approaches. These compelling neuromorphic networks solve a diverse range of problems representative of brain-like computation, such as event-based data processing, adaptive control, constrained optimization, sparse feature regression, and graph search.},

  abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are powerful computational tools for a large variety of tasks (Goodfellow, 2016). Their architecture, composed of layers of repeated identical neural units, draws inspiration from visual neuroscience. However, biological circuits contain a myriad of additional details and complexity not translated to CNNs, including diverse neural cell types (Tasic, 2018). Many possible roles for neural cell types have been proposed, including: learning, stabilizing excitation and inhibition, and diverse normalization (Marblestone, 2016; Gouwens, 2019). Here we investigate whether neural cell types, instantiated as diverse activation functions in CNNs, can assist in the feed-forward computational abilities of neural circuits. Our heterogeneous cell type networks mix multiple activation functions within each activation layer. We assess the value of mixed activation functions by comparing image classification performance to that of homogeneous control networks with only one activation function per network. We observe that mixing activation functions can improve the image classification abilities of CNNs. Importantly, we find larger improvements when the activation functions are more diverse, and in more constrained networks. Our results suggest a feed-forward computational role for diverse cell types in biological circuits. Additionally, our results open new avenues for the development of more powerful CNNs.},

At the macro scale, neuroimaging modalities measure global activity fluctuations organized into spatiotemporal patterns across the entire brain.

We argue that diverse experimental observations on the dimensionality and variability of neural activity can be reconciled by considering how activity propagates in space and time on multiple spatial scales.},

  abstract = {Astrocytes are key cellular partners for neurons in the central nervous system. Astrocytes react to virtually all types of pathological alterations in brain homeostasis by significant morphological and molecular changes. This response was classically viewed as stereotypical and is called astrogliosis or astrocyte reactivity. It was long considered as a nonspecific, secondary reaction to pathological conditions, offering no clues on disease-causing mechanisms and with little therapeutic value. However, many studies over the last 30 years have underlined the crucial and active roles played by astrocytes in physiology, ranging from metabolic support, synapse maturation, and pruning to fine regulation of synaptic transmission. This prompted researchers to explore how these new astrocyte functions were changed in disease, and they reported alterations in many of them (sometimes beneficial, mostly deleterious). More recently, cell-specific transcriptomics revealed that astrocytes undergo massive changes in gene expression when they become reactive. This observation further stressed that reactive astrocytes may be very different from normal, nonreactive astrocytes and could influence disease outcomes. To make the picture even more complex, both normal and reactive astrocytes were shown to be molecularly and functionally heterogeneous. Very little is known about the specific roles that each subtype of reactive astrocytes may play in different disease contexts. In this review, we have interrogated researchers in the field to identify and discuss points of consensus and controversies about reactive astrocytes, starting with their very name. We then present the emerging knowledge on these cells and future challenges in this field.},

  abstract = {Reactive astrocytes are prominent in the cellular response to spinal cord injury (SCI), but their roles are not well understood. We used a transgenic mouse model to study the consequences of selective and conditional ablation of reactive astrocytes after stab or crush SCI. Mice expressing a glial fibrillary acid protein-herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase transgene were given mild or moderate SCI and treated with the antiviral agent ganciclovir (GCV) to ablate dividing, reactive, transgene-expressing astrocytes in the immediate vicinity of the SCI. Small stab injuries in control mice caused little tissue disruption, little demyelination, no obvious neuronal death, and mild, reversible functional impairments. Equivalent small stab injuries in transgenic mice given GCV to ablate reactive astrocytes caused failure of blood-brain barrier repair, leukocyte infiltration, local tissue disruption, severe demyelination, neuronal and oligodendrocyte death, and pronounced motor deficits. Moderate crush injuries in control mice caused focal tissue disruption and cellular degeneration, with moderate, primarily reversible motor impairments. Equivalent moderate crush injuries combined with ablation of reactive astrocytes caused widespread tissue disruption, pronounced cellular degeneration, and failure of wound contraction, with severe persisting motor deficits. These findings show that reactive astrocytes provide essential activities that protect tissue and preserve function after mild or moderate SCI. In nontransgenic animals, crush or contusion SCIs routinely exhibit regions of degenerated tissue that are devoid of astrocytes. Our findings suggest that identifying ways to preserve reactive astrocytes, to augment their protective functions, or both, may lead to novel approaches to reducing secondary tissue degeneration and improving functional outcome after SCI.},

  abstract = {In tasks that are designed to explore some facet of cognitive functioning, the participant's response on each trial is influenced by the specific combination of conditions occurring on that trial and the trial that preceded it. This residual influence from the previous trial indicates that information presented during, or the actions required by, the previous trial leaves an imprint on the brain. We provide four examples of previous trial effects and we show how these imprints are manifest in the activity of single neurons that participate in producing the response.The frontal eye fields and superior colliculi function like the 'salience map' used in computational models of visual attention. A salience map is a two-dimensional, topographically organized map that represents the distinctiveness of objects in the visual scene. Likewise, neurons in the frontal eye fields and the superior colliculi represent the salience of visual objects through the overall level of activity elicited by the presentation of the object and how quickly the sensory response discriminates between different objects. In all of the examples presented, the previous trial exerts its influence by changing the salience of the target on the next trial.When performing a simple two-alternative choice saccade task (in which a target appears to the left or right, and a monkey initiates saccade to the target's location), monkeys respond faster when the target appears in the same location across consecutive trials. This repetition advantage arises because increased pre-target activity of neurons in the superior colliculus enhances the relative salience of that region on the superior colliculus map and of the target when it appears at that location on the next trial.In visual search, an array of objects is presented to an observer who initiates a saccade to the odd one (defined by colour). Monkeys respond faster when the colour of the target remains the same across consecutive trials and they produce more competing responses when the colour changes. Viewing these previous trial effects as changes in the salience of the distractor provides a succinct way to explain both phenomena. When the colour remains the same, the salience of the target is high and the salience of the distractors is low, allowing selection to be completed easily. When the colour changes, the salience of the target is low and the salience of the distractors is high, causing the distractors to compete more for selection.Inhibition of return describes the tendency of observers to be slower to reorient to a previously attended location, and is observed in visual search and the cue\textendash target model. In both tasks, the previous trial (or event) decreases the salience of the target.},

Gating of information flow from sensory to motor areas could protect memory from interference during decision-making, but the underlying network mechanisms are not understood. Here, we trained mice to detect optogenetic stimulation of the somatosensory cortex, with a delay separating sensation and action. During the delay, distracting stimuli lost influence on behavior over time, even though distractor-evoked neural activity percolated through the cortex without attenuation. Instead, choice-encoding activity in the motor cortex became progressively less sensitive to the impact of distractors. Reverse engineering of neural networks trained to reproduce motor cortex activity revealed that the reduction in sensitivity to distractors was caused by a growing separation in the neural activity space between attractors that encode alternative decisions. Our results show that communication between brain regions can be gated via attractor dynamics, which control the degree of commitment to an action.},

Such harmonic complex tones (HCTs) evoke a pitch corresponding to their F0, which plays a key role in the perception of speech and music. ``Pitch-selective'' neurons have been identified in non-primary auditory cortex of marmoset monkeys. Noninvasive studies point to a putative ``pitch center'' located in a homologous cortical region in humans. It remains unclear whether there is sufficient spectral and temporal information available at the level of primary auditory cortex (A1) to enable reliable pitch extraction in non-primary auditory cortex. Here we evaluated multiunit responses to HCTs in A1 of awake macaques using a stimulus design employed in auditory nerve studies of pitch encoding. The F0 of the HCTs was varied in small increments, such that harmonics of the HCTs fell either on the peak or on the sides of the neuronal pure tone tuning functions. Resultant response-amplitude-versus-harmonic-number functions (``rate-place profiles'') displayed a periodic pattern reflecting the neuronal representation of individual HCT harmonics. Consistent with psychoacoustic findings in humans, lower harmonics were better resolved in rate-place profiles than higher harmonics. Lower F0s were also temporally represented by neuronal phase-locking to the periodic waveform of the HCTs. Findings indicate that population responses in A1 contain sufficient spectral and temporal information for extracting the pitch of HCTs by neurons in downstream cortical areas that receive their input from A1.},

  abstract = {Studies of the biology of music (as of language) are highly interdisciplinary and demand the integration of diverse strands of evidence. In this paper, I present a comparative perspective on the biology and evolution of music, stressing the value of comparisons both with human language, and with those animal communication systems traditionally termed ``song''. A comparison of the ``design features'' of music with those of language reveals substantial overlap, along with some important differences. Most of these differences appear to stem from semantic, rather than structural, factors, suggesting a shared formal core of music and language. I next review various animal communication systems that appear related to human music, either by analogy (bird and whale ``song'') or potential homology (great ape bimanual drumming). A crucial comparative distinction is between learned, complex signals (like language, music and birdsong) and unlearned signals (like laughter, ape calls, or bird calls). While human vocalizations clearly build upon an acoustic and emotional foundation shared with other primates and mammals, vocal learning has evolved independently in our species since our divergence with chimpanzees. The convergent evolution of vocal learning in other species offers a powerful window into psychological and neural constraints influencing the evolution of complex signaling systems (including both song and speech), while ape drumming presents a fascinating potential homology with human instrumental music. I next discuss the archeological data relevant to music evolution, concluding on the basis of prehistoric bone flutes that instrumental music is at least 40,000 years old, and perhaps much older. I end with a brief review of adaptive functions proposed for music, concluding that no one selective force (e.g., sexual selection) is adequate to explaining all aspects of human music. I suggest that questions about the past function of music are unlikely to be answered definitively and are thus a poor choice as a research focus for biomusicology. In contrast, a comparative approach to music promises rich dividends for our future understanding of the biology and evolution of music.},

Methodology and Findings We assayed the FA composition and abundance in CSF fractions from cognitively healthy (CH), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD study participants using gas chromatography - mass spectrometry. In the SF fraction, concentration of docosahexaenoic acid [DHA, (C22:6n-3)] was less in AD compared with CH, while alpha linolenic acid [{$\alpha$}-LNA, (C18:3n-3)] was lower in MCI compared with CH. In the NP fraction, levels of SAFAs (C15:0, C16:0) and a MUFA (C15:1) differentiated CH from MCI, while two MUFAs (C15:1, C19:1) and four PUFAs (C20:2n-6, C20:3n-3, C22:4n-6, C22:5n-3) were higher in AD compared with CH. Levels of even-chain free SAFA and total free FA levels were higher in AD, levels of odd-chain free SAFAs, MUFAs, n-3 PUFAs, and total PUFA, were lower in AD compared with CH. Free n-6 PUFA levels were similar in all three groups. Conclusions and Significance FA metabolism is compartmentalized differently in NP versus SF fractions of CSF, and altered FA levels reflect the importance of abnormal metabolism and oxidative pathways in AD. Depleted DHA in CSF fractions in AD is consistent with the importance of n-3 PUFAs in cognitive function, and suggests that disturbed PUFA metabolism contributes to AD pathology. This study of FA levels in CSF fractions from different cognitive stages shows potential AD biomarkers, and provides further insight into cell membrane dysfunctions, including mechanisms leading to amyloid production.},

The perception of spots of light, called phosphenes, resulting from microstimulation of the visual pathway, suggests the possibility of creating meaningful percept made of phosphenes. However, to date electrical stimulation of V1 has still not resulted in perception of phosphenated images that goes beyond punctate spots of light. In this review, we summarize the clinical and experimental progress that has been made in generating phosphenes and modulating their associated perceptual characteristics in human and macaque primary visual cortex (V1). We focus specifically on the effects of different microstimulation parameters on perception and we analyse key challenges facing the generation of meaningful artificial percepts. Finally, we propose solutions to these challenges based on the application of supervised learning of population codes for spatial stimulation of visual cortex.},

At about the same time, new models of color constancy appeared, along with physiological data on cortical mechanisms and photographic colorimetric measurements of natural scenes. Since then, as this review shows, there have been many advances. The theoretical requirements for constancy have been better delineated and the range of experimental techniques has been greatly expanded; novel invariant properties of images and a variety of neural mechanisms have been identified; and increasing recognition has been given to the relevance of natural surfaces and scenes as laboratory stimuli. Even so, there remain many theoretical and experimental challenges, not least to develop an account of color constancy that goes beyond deterministic and relatively simple laboratory stimuli and instead deals with the intrinsically variable nature of surfaces and illuminations present in the natural world.},

Observers can, however, make fast and reliable discriminations between changes in illuminant and changes in the reflecting properties of scenes, a discriminative ability that might be based on a visual coding of spatial colour relations. This coding could be provided by the ratios of cone-photoreceptor excitations produced by light from different surfaces: for a large class of pigmented surfaces and for surfaces with random spectral reflectances, these ratios are statistically almost invariant under changes in illumination by light from the sun and sky or from a planckian radiator. Cone-excitation ratios offer a possible, although not necessarily unique, basis for perceptual colour constancy in so far as it concerns colour relations.}

  abstract = {Hitherto communication theory was based on two alternative methods of signal analysis. One is the description of the signal as a function of time; the other is Fourier analysis. Both are idealizations, as the first method operates with sharply defined instants of time, the second with infinite wave-trains of rigorously defined frequencies. But our everyday experiences\textemdash especially our auditory sensations\textemdash insist on a description in terms of both time and frequency. In the present paper this point of view is developed in quantitative language. Signals are represented in two dimensions, with time and frequency as co-ordinates. Such two-dimensional representations can be called ``information diagrams,'' as areas in them are proportional to the number of independent data which they can convey. This is a consequence of the fact that the frequency of a signal which is not of infinite duration can be defined only with a certain inaccuracy, which is inversely proportional to the duration, and vice versa. This ``uncertainty relation'' suggests a new method of description, intermediate between the two extremes of time analysis and spectral analysis. There are certain ``elementary signals'' which occupy the smallest possible area in the information diagram. They are harmonic oscillations modulated by a ``probability pulse.'' Each elementary signal can be considered as conveying exactly one datum, or one ``quantum of information.'' Any signal can be expanded in terms of these by a process which includes time analysis and Fourier analysis as extreme cases.These new methods of analysis, which involve some of the mathematical apparatus of quantum theory, are illustrated by application to some problems of transmission theory, such as direct generation of single sidebands, signals transmitted in minimum time through limited frequency channels, frequency modulation and time-division multiplex telephony.},

  abstract = {1. The biosonar signal (pulse) of the mustached bat, Pteronotus parnellii parnellii, has four harmonics (H1-4), each consisting of a long constant-frequency component (CF1-4) followed by a short frequency-modulated component (FM1-4). As the bat approaches a target, it systematically modifies its pulses to optimize the extraction of information from the echoes. These behavioral responses include 1) Doppler-shift (DS) compensation in which the bat adjusts the frequency of its pulses to correct for the DS in the echoes. This maintains the echo CF2 at a frequency to which the bat's cochlea is very sharply tuned, slightly above the CF2 frequency of the bat's pulses when it is at rest (Frest, approximately 61 kHz); 2) echo intensity compensation, in which the bat lowers its pulse intensity as it approaches a large target, thus maintaining the echo intensity within a suitable range for auditory processing; and 3) and 4) duration and rate adjustments, in which the bat first increases its pulse duration to facilitate target identification, then shortens its pulse duration while increasing its pulse rate to facilitate target analysis. 2. We examined these responses, especially DS compensation, by swinging bats on a pendulum toward a large target over a distance of 3.6 m. Eight bats were given 15-30 swings per day for 6-25 days. 1) On 97\% of all swings the bats showed strong DS compensation as the pendulum approached the target. They did not show DS compensation on the backswing. 2) On 40-50\% of all swings, the bats clearly displayed the other responses. The bats typically increased their pulse intensity a small amount early in the pendulum swing, then decreased pulse intensity by as much as 18 dB as the target was more closely approached. They increased their pulse intensity during the backswing. 3) Pulse duration increased from approximately 20 to 23 ms early in the forward swing, decreased to approximately 18 ms as the target was more closely approached, and then increased to 20 ms by the end of the backswing. 4) The instantaneous repetition rate increased from approximately 17 pulses/s at the start of the forward swing to approximately 28 pulses/s near the target, then decreased to approximately 10 pulses/s by the end of the backswing. Pulses usually occurred in trains of 1-2 pulses, with longer trains occasionally occurring near the target. 3. The maximum DS on the pendulum was 1.34 kHz, and the maximum DS compensation was 146 +/- 98 (SD) Hz less than this value.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {Colour vision is an integral part of the human visual system. It relies on the presence of three types of cone photoreceptor in the retina, which have different but overlapping wavelength tuning curves.Colour information is sent in three colour-opponent channels from they eye to the brain. These 'cardinal' mechanisms, which are usually termed black\textendash white, red\textendash green and blue\textendash yellow, have been characterized psychophysically, physiologically and computationally to be independent and efficient.In the primary visual cortex (area V1), a large proportion of neurons respond selectively to colour information. Most of these neurons also respond to variations in the brightness of visual stimuli. The colour combinations that are preferred by these neurons are no longer constrained to the three cardinal directions. In higher visual areas, neurons become more selective in their colour tuning and respond only to a small range of colours. About a third of neurons in area V2 combine their inputs in such a nonlinear manner.Colour is processed jointly with other visual attributes, such as orientation, depth and motion. Neurons in different anatomically defined compartments of the second visual area, for example, show joint selectivity for these different attributes. For most psychophysical tasks, the visual system works just as well for coloured stimuli as it does for black and white stimuli, once the magnitude of the different stimuli is made comparable.Colour constancy describes the ability of the visual system to discount large changes in illumination, so that objects look the same colour even under different illuminations. Both retinal and cortical factors contribute to colour constancy. Cells in V1 with both spatial and chromatic opponency ('double-opponent' cells) might be important for this achievement.People with an acquired colour vision deficiency (achromatopsia) often have damage to a small region in the lateral occipital cortex. The same region is typically highly active in neuroimaging experiments when subjects view coloured scenes. The residual abilities of achromatopsic patients show that their main deficit seems to be the assignment of colours to objects, rather than the perception of colours per se.Our understanding of the cortical processing of colour is still far from complete. A better understanding of the relationships between areas of monkey visual cortex and apparently homologous areas in the human brain will help us to address remaining questions, such as the degree to which colour information is segregated from other visual attributes. In the long run, more emphasis has to be given to the computations that are performed on the colour signals (and visual signals in general), rather than to the localization of regions that are important for the analysis of colour.},

To better constrain the definition of neuronal cell types, we characterized the transcriptomes and intrinsic physiological properties of over 4,200 mouse visual cortical GABAergic interneurons and reconstructed the local morphologies of 517 of those neurons. We find that most transcriptomic types (t-types) occupy specific laminar positions within visual cortex, and, for most types, the cells mapping to a t-type exhibit consistent electrophysiological and morphological properties. These properties display both discrete and continuous variation among t-types. Through multimodal integrated analysis, we define 28 met-types that have congruent morphological, electrophysiological, and transcriptomic properties and robust mutual predictability. We identify layer-specific axon innervation pattern as a defining feature distinguishing different met-types. These met-types represent a unified definition of cortical GABAergic interneuron types, providing a systematic framework to capture existing knowledge and bridge future analyses across different modalities.},

  abstract = {Selective attention allows focusing on only part of the incoming sensory information. Neurons in the extrastriate visual cortex reflect such selective processing when different stimuli are simultaneously present in their large receptive fields. Their spiking response then resembles the response to the attended stimulus when presented in isolation. Unclear is where in the neuronal pathway attention intervenes to achieve such selective signal routing and processing. To investigate this question, we tagged two equivalent visual stimuli by independent broadband luminance noise and used the spectral coherence of these behaviorally irrelevant signals with the field potential of a local neuronal population in male macaque monkeys' area V4 as a measure for their respective causal influences. This new experimental paradigm revealed that signal transmission was considerably weaker for the not-attended stimulus. Furthermore, our results show that attention does not need to modulate responses in the input populations sending signals to V4 to selectively represent a stimulus, nor do they suggest a change of the V4 neurons' output gain depending on their feature similarity with the stimuli. Our results rather imply that selective attention uses a gating mechanism comprising the synaptic ``inputs'' that transmit signals from upstream areas into the V4 neurons. A minimal model implementing attention-dependent routing by gamma-band synchrony replicated the attentional gating effect and the signals' spectral transfer characteristics. It supports the proposal that selective interareal gamma-band synchrony subserves signal routing and explains our experimental finding that attention selectively gates signals already at the level of afferent synaptic input. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Depending on the behavioral context, the brain needs to channel the flow of information through its networks of massively interconnected neurons. We designed an experiment that allows to causally assess routing of information originating from an attended object. We found that attention ``gates'' signals at the interplay between afferent fibers and the local neurons. A minimal model demonstrated that coherent gamma-rhythmic activity ({$\sim$}60 Hz) between local neurons and their afferent-providing input neurons can realize the gating. Importantly, the attended signals did not need to be amplified already in an earlier processing stage, nor did they get amplified by a simple output response modulation. The method provides a useful tool to study mechanisms of dynamic network configuration underlying cognitive processes.},

We show that preventing the formation of neuroinflammatory reactive astrocytes prevents the death of RGCs normally seen in a mouse model of glaucoma. Furthermore, we show that these spared RGCs are electrophysiologically functional and thus still have potential value for the function and regeneration of the retina. Finally, we demonstrate that the death of RGCs depends on a combination of both an injury to the neurons and the presence of reactive astrocytes, suggesting a model that may explain why reactive astrocytes are toxic only in some circumstances. Altogether, these findings highlight reactive astrocytes as drivers of RGC death in a chronic neurodegenerative disease of the eye.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

To exploit such a modular architecture for computation, the brain has to be able to regulate the flow of spiking activity between these specialized networks. In this Opinion article, we review various prominent mechanisms that may underlie communication between neuronal networks. We show that communication between neuronal networks can be understood as trajectories in a two-dimensional state space, spanned by the properties of the input. Thus, we propose a common framework to understand neuronal communication mediated by seemingly different mechanisms. We also suggest that the nesting of slow (for example, alpha-band and theta-band) oscillations and fast (gamma-band) oscillations can serve as an important control mechanism that allows or prevents spiking signals to be routed between specific networks. We argue that slow oscillations can modulate the time required to establish network resonance or entrainment and, thereby, regulate communication between neuronal networks.},

It is not known whether individual neurons send projections only to single cortical areas or distribute signals across multiple targets. Here we determine the projection patterns of 591 individual neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex using whole-brain fluorescence-based axonal tracing and high-throughput DNA sequencing of genetically barcoded neurons (MAPseq). Projections were highly diverse and divergent, collectively targeting at least 18 cortical and subcortical areas. Most neurons targeted multiple cortical areas, often in non-random combinations, suggesting that sub-classes of intracortical projection neurons exist. Our results indicate that the dominant mode of intracortical information transfer is not based on `one neuron\textendash one target area' mapping. Instead, signals carried by individual cortical neurons are shared across subsets of target areas, and thus concurrently contribute to multiple functional pathways.},

Previous approaches that have used matching paradigms to quantify color constancy found degrees of constancy between 20\% and 80\%. Here, we studied color constancy in a color-naming task under different conditions of surround illumination and patch size. Observers categorized more than 400 patches for each illumination condition. This allows one to overcome inherent limitations in color naming and to study the changes in color categories under illumination changes. When small central test patches with a full context illumination were categorized, observers followed the illumination shift almost completely, showing a high degree of constancy (99\%). Reducing the available context information or increasing the patch size decreased the degree of constancy to about 50\%. Moderate degrees of constancy (66\%) occurred even when the test patches were never viewed simultaneously but only in temporal alternation with the illumination. Boundaries between color categories were largely stable within and across observers under neutral illumination. Under changing illumination, there were small but systematic variations in the color category boundaries. Color category boundaries tended to rotate away from the illumination color. This variation was largest under full context conditions where highest degrees of color constancy were obtained.}

We used Cre driver lines (mice expressing Cre recombinase) to comprehensively and selectively label brain-wide connections by layer and class of projection neuron. Through observations of axon termination patterns, we have derived a set of generalized anatomical rules to describe corticocortical, thalamocortical and corticothalamic projections. We have built a model to assign connection patterns between areas as either feedforward or feedback, and generated testable predictions of hierarchical positions for individual cortical and thalamic areas and for cortical network modules. Our results show that cell-class-specific connections are organized in a shallow hierarchy within the mouse corticothalamic network.},

We identified fast transcriptomic changes in astrocytes occurring within hours that drastically change over time. By sequencing \textasciitilde 80,000 astrocytes at single-cell resolution, we show that inflammation causes a widespread response with subtypes of astrocytes undergoing distinct inflammatory transitions with defined transcriptomic profiles. We also attribute key sub-states of inflammation-induced reactive astrocytes to specific brain regions using spatial transcriptomics and in situ hybridization. Together, our datasets provide a powerful resource for profiling astrocyte heterogeneity and will be useful for understanding the biological importance of regionally constrained reactive astrocyte sub-states.},

Does the brain use similar brute-force fitting processes to learn how to perceive and act upon the world? Recent advances in artificial neural networks have exposed the power of optimizing millions of synaptic weights over millions of observations to operate robustly in real-world contexts. These models do not learn simple, human-interpretable rules or representations of the world; rather, they use local computations to interpolate over task-relevant manifolds in a high-dimensional parameter space. Counterintuitively, similar to evolutionary processes, over-parameterized models can be simple and parsimonious, as they provide a versatile, robust solution for learning a diverse set of functions. This new family of direct-fit models present a radical challenge to many of the theoretical assumptions in psychology and neuroscience. At the same time, this shift in perspective establishes unexpected links with developmental and ecological psychology.},

These modulations have been attributed to circuit dynamics involving either multiple stable states (``attractors'') or chaotic activity. Here we show that a qualitatively different dynamical regime, involving fluctuations about a single, stimulus-driven attractor in a loosely balanced excitatory-inhibitory network (the stochastic ``stabilized supralinear network''), best explains these modulations. Given the supralinear input/output functions of cortical neurons, increased stimulus drive strengthens effective network connectivity. This shifts the balance from interactions that amplify~variability to suppressive inhibitory feedback, quenching correlated variability around more strongly driven steady states. Comparing to previously published and original data analyses, we show that this mechanism, unlike previous proposals, uniquely accounts for the spatial patterns and fast temporal dynamics of variability suppression. Specifying the cortical operating regime is key~to understanding the computations underlying perception.},

This observation supports the vocal learning hypothesis that suggests rhythmic entrainment to be a by-product of the vocal learning mechanisms that are shared by several bird and mammal species, including humans, but that are only weakly developed, or missing entirely, in nonhuman primates. To test this hypothesis we measured auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) in two rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), probing a well-documented component in humans, the mismatch negativity (MMN) to study rhythmic expectation. We demonstrate for the first time in rhesus monkeys that, in response to infrequent deviants in pitch that were presented in a continuous sound stream using an oddball paradigm, a comparable ERP component can be detected with negative deflections in early latencies (Experiment 1). Subsequently we tested whether rhesus monkeys can detect gaps (omissions at random positions in the sound stream; Experiment 2) and, using more complex stimuli, also the beat (omissions at the first position of a musical unit, i.e. the `downbeat'; Experiment 3). In contrast to what has been shown in human adults and newborns (using identical stimuli and experimental paradigm), the results suggest that rhesus monkeys are not able to detect the beat in music. These findings are in support of the hypothesis that beat induction (the cognitive mechanism that supports the perception of a regular pulse from a varying rhythm) is species-specific and absent in nonhuman primates. In addition, the findings support the auditory timing dissociation hypothesis, with rhesus monkeys being sensitive to rhythmic grouping (detecting the start of a rhythmic group), but not to the induced beat (detecting a regularity from a varying rhythm).},

Applying BRICseq to the mouse neocortex, we find that region-to-region connectivity provides a simple bridge relating transcriptome to activity: the spatial expression patterns of a few genes predict region-to-region connectivity, and connectivity predicts activity correlations. We also exploited BRICseq to map the mutant BTBR mouse brain, which lacks a corpus callosum, and recapitulated its known connectopathies. BRICseq allows individual laboratories to compare how age, sex, environment, genetics, and species affect neuronal wiring and to integrate these with functional activity and gene expression.},

Short-term memories are correlated with slow neural dynamics, including selective persistent activity, which can be maintained over seconds. In a delayed response task that requires short-term memory, neurons in the mouse anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) show persistent activity that instructs future actions. To determine the principles that underlie this persistent activity, here we combined intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology with optogenetic perturbations and network modelling. We show that during the delay epoch, the activity of ALM neurons moved towards discrete end points that correspond to specific movement directions. These end points were robust to transient shifts in ALM activity caused by optogenetic perturbations. Perturbations occasionally switched the population dynamics to the other end point, followed by incorrect actions. Our results show that discrete attractor dynamics underlie short-term memory related to motor planning.},

  abstract = {Metabolic coordination between neurons and astrocytes is critical for the health of the brain. However, neuron-astrocyte coupling of lipid metabolism, particularly in response to neural activity, remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we demonstrate that toxic fatty acids (FAs) produced in hyperactive neurons are transferred to astrocytic lipid droplets by ApoE-positive lipid particles. Astrocytes consume the FAs stored in lipid droplets via mitochondrial {$\beta$}-oxidation in response to neuronal activity and turn on a detoxification gene expression program. Our findings reveal that FA metabolism is coupled in neurons and astrocytes to protect neurons from FA toxicity during periods of enhanced activity. This coordinated mechanism for metabolizing FAs could underlie both homeostasis and a variety of disease states of the brain.},

  abstract = {Identifying secreted mediators that drive the cognitive benefits of exercise holds great promise for the treatment of cognitive decline in ageing or Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we show that irisin, the cleaved and circulating form of the exercise-induced membrane protein FNDC5, is sufficient to confer the benefits of exercise on cognitive function. Genetic deletion of Fndc5/irisin (global Fndc5 knock-out (KO) mice; F5KO) impairs cognitive function in exercise, ageing and AD. Diminished pattern separation in F5KO mice can be rescued by delivering irisin directly into the dentate gyrus, suggesting that irisin is the active moiety. In F5KO mice, adult-born neurons in the dentate gyrus are morphologically, transcriptionally and functionally abnormal. Importantly, elevation of circulating irisin levels by peripheral delivery of irisin via adeno-associated viral overexpression in the liver results in enrichment of central irisin and is sufficient to improve both the cognitive deficit and neuropathology in AD mouse models. Irisin is a crucial regulator of the cognitive benefits of exercise and is a potential therapeutic agent for treating cognitive disorders including AD.},

These models utilize connectivity to specify the transfer of information via neural activity flow processes, successfully predicting the formation of cognitive representations in empirical neural data. The success of these models supports the possibility that localized neural functions mechanistically emerge (are computed) from distributed activity flow processes that are specified primarily by connectivity patterns.},

  abstract = {We review recent work on computational models of focal visual attention, with emphasis on the bottom-up, saliency- or image-based control of attentional deployment. We highlight five important trends that have emerged from the computational literature: First, the perceptual saliency of stimuli critically depends on surrounding context; that is, the same object may or may not appear salient depending on the nature and arrangement of other objects in the scene. Computationally, this means that contextual influences, such as non-classical surround interactions, must be included in models. Second, a unique 'saliency map' topographically encoding for stimulus conspicuity over the visual scene has proved to be an efficient and plausible bottom-up control strategy. Many successful models are based on such architecture, and electrophysiological as well as psychophysical studies have recently supported the idea that saliency is explicitly encoded in the brain. Third, inhibition-of-return (IOR), the process by which the currently attended location is transiently inhibited, is a critical element of attentional deployment. Without IOR, attention would endlessly be attracted towards the most salient stimulus. IOR thus implements a memory of recently visited locations, and allows attention to thoroughly scan our visual environment. Fourth, attention and eye movements tightly interplay, posing computational challenges with respect to the coordinate system used to control attention. Understanding the interaction between overt and covert attention is particularly important for models concerned with visual search. Last, scene understanding and object recognition strongly constrain the selection of attended locations. Although several models have approached, in an information-theoretical sense, the problem of optimally deploying attention to analyse a scene, biologically plausible implementations of such a computational strategy remain to be developed.},

Deposition of A{$\beta$} in the medial parietal cortex appears to be the first stage in the development of AD, although tau aggregates in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) precede A{$\beta$} deposition in cognitively healthy older people. Whether aggregation of tau in the MTL is the first stage in AD or a fairly benign phenomenon that may be transformed and spread in the presence of A{$\beta$} is a major unresolved question. Despite a strong link between A{$\beta$} and tau, the relationship between A{$\beta$} and neurodegeneration is weak; rather, it is tau that is associated with brain atrophy and hypometabolism, which, in turn, are related to cognition. Although there is support for an interaction between A{$\beta$} and tau resulting in neurodegeneration that leads to dementia, the unknown nature of this interaction, the strikingly different patterns of brain A{$\beta$} and tau deposition and the appearance of neurodegeneration in the absence of A{$\beta$} and tau are challenges to this model that ultimately must be explained.},

These datasets do not yet exist, and if they did we would have no way of evaluating whether or not the algorithmically-generated insights were sufficient or even correct. To address this, here we take a classical microprocessor as a model organism, and use our ability to perform arbitrary experiments on it to see if popular data analysis methods from neuroscience can elucidate the way it processes information. Microprocessors are among those artificial information processing systems that are both complex and that we understand at all levels, from the overall logical flow, via logical gates, to the dynamics of transistors. We show that the approaches reveal interesting structure in the data but do not meaningfully describe the hierarchy of information processing in the microprocessor. This suggests current analytic approaches in neuroscience may fall short of producing meaningful understanding of neural systems, regardless of the amount of data. Additionally, we argue for scientists using complex non-linear dynamical systems with known ground truth, such as the microprocessor as a validation platform for time-series and structure discovery methods.},

  abstract = {Animals sense the environment through pathways that link sensory organs to the brain. In the visual system, these feedforward pathways define the classical feedforward receptive field (ffRF), the area in space in which visual stimuli excite a neuron1. The visual system also uses visual context\textemdash the visual scene surrounding a stimulus\textemdash to predict the content of the stimulus2, and accordingly, neurons have been identified that are excited by stimuli outside their ffRF3\textendash 8. However, the mechanisms that generate excitation to stimuli outside the ffRF are unclear. Here we show that feedback projections onto excitatory neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex generate a second receptive field that is driven by stimuli outside the ffRF. The stimulation of this feedback receptive field (fbRF) elicits responses that are slower and are delayed in comparison with those resulting from the stimulation of the ffRF. These responses are preferentially reduced by anaesthesia and by silencing higher visual areas. Feedback inputs from higher visual areas have scattered receptive fields relative to their putative targets in the primary visual cortex, which enables the generation of the fbRF. Neurons with fbRFs are located in cortical layers that receive strong feedback projections and are absent in the main input layer, which is consistent with a laminar processing hierarchy. The observation that large, uniform stimuli\textemdash which cover both the fbRF and the ffRF\textemdash suppress these responses indicates that the fbRF and the ffRF are mutually antagonistic. Whereas somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons are driven by these large stimuli, inhibitory neurons that express parvalbumin and vasoactive intestinal peptide have mutually antagonistic fbRF and ffRF, similar to excitatory neurons. Feedback projections may therefore enable neurons to use context to estimate information that is missing from the ffRF and to report differences in stimulus features across visual space, regardless of whether excitation occurs inside or outside the ffRF. By complementing the ffRF, the fbRF that we identify here could contribute to predictive processing.},

We used electrical microstimulation to perturb the propagation of neuronal activity between areas V1 and V4 in monkeys performing a texture-segregation task. In both areas, microstimulation locally caused a brief phase of excitation, followed by inhibition. Both these effects propagated faithfully in the feedforward direction from V1 to V4. Stimulation of V4, however, caused little V1 excitation, but it did yield a delayed suppression during the late phase of visually driven activity. This suppression was pronounced for the V1 figure representation and weaker for background representations.

  abstract = {Color constancy is our ability to perceive constant surface colors despite changes in illumination. Although color constancy has been studied extensively, its mechanisms are still largely unknown. Three classic hypotheses are that constancy is mediated by local adaptation, by adaptation to the spatial mean of the image, or by adaptation to the most intense image region. We measure color constancy under nearly natural viewing conditions, by using a design that allows us to test these three hypotheses directly. By suitable stimulus manipulation, we are able to titrate the degree of constancy between 11\% and 83\%, indicating that we have achieved good laboratory control. Our results rule out all three classic hypotheses and thus suggest that there is more to constancy than can be easily explained by the action of simple visual mechanisms.},

These approaches are coupled with a deep-seated, often tacit, belief in the reductionist program for understanding the link between the brain and behavior. The aim of this program is causal explanation through neural manipulations that allow testing of necessity and sufficiency claims. We argue, however, that another equally important approach seeks an alternative form of understanding through careful theoretical and experimental decomposition of behavior. Specifically, the detailed analysis of tasks and of the behavior they elicit is best suited for discovering component processes and their underlying algorithms. In most cases, we argue that study of the neural implementation of behavior is best investigated \emph{after} such behavioral work. Thus, we advocate a more pluralistic notion of neuroscience when it comes to the brain-behavior relationship: behavioral work provides understanding, whereas neural interventions test causality.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Each system serves its own specialized behavioral, cognitive, or affective function, collectively providing the raison d'\^etre for the ventral visual pathway.

Comparatively, musical training, another type of sensory enrichment, translates to expertise in cognitive processing and refined biological processing of sound in both cortical and subcortical structures. Therefore, we asked whether bilingualism can also promote experience-dependent plasticity in subcortical auditory processing. We found that adolescent bilinguals, listening to the speech syllable [da], encoded the stimulus more robustly than age-matched monolinguals. Specifically, bilinguals showed enhanced encoding of the fundamental frequency, a feature known to underlie pitch perception and grouping of auditory objects. This enhancement was associated with executive function advantages. Thus, through experience-related tuning of attention, the bilingual auditory system becomes highly efficient in automatically processing sound. This study provides biological evidence for system-wide neural plasticity in auditory experts that facilitates a tight coupling of sensory and cognitive functions.},

  abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of neural network parameters during training is one of the key challenges in building a theoretical foundation for deep learning. A central obstacle is that the motion of a network in high-dimensional parameter space undergoes discrete finite steps along complex stochastic gradients derived from real-world datasets. We circumvent this obstacle through a unifying theoretical framework based on intrinsic symmetries embedded in a network's architecture that are present for any dataset. We show that any such symmetry imposes stringent geometric constraints on gradients and Hessians, leading to an associated conservation law in the continuous-time limit of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), akin to Noether's theorem in physics. We further show that finite learning rates used in practice can actually break these symmetry induced conservation laws. We apply tools from finite difference methods to derive modified gradient flow, a differential equation that better approximates the numerical trajectory taken by SGD at finite learning rates. We combine modified gradient flow with our framework of symmetries to derive exact integral expressions for the dynamics of certain parameter combinations. We empirically validate our analytic expressions for learning dynamics on VGG-16 trained on Tiny ImageNet. Overall, by exploiting symmetry, our work demonstrates that we can analytically describe the learning dynamics of various parameter combinations at finite learning rates and batch sizes for state of the art architectures trained on any dataset.},

  abstract = {The properties of individual neurons are often analyzed in order to understand the biological and artificial neural networks in which they're embedded. Class selectivity-typically defined as how different a neuron's responses are across different classes of stimuli or data samples-is commonly used for this purpose. However, it remains an open question whether it is necessary and/or sufficient for deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn class selectivity in individual units. We investigated the causal impact of class selectivity on network function by directly regularizing for or against class selectivity. Using this regularizer to reduce class selectivity across units in convolutional neural networks increased test accuracy by over 2\% for ResNet18 trained on Tiny ImageNet. For ResNet20 trained on CIFAR10 we could reduce class selectivity by a factor of 2.5 with no impact on test accuracy, and reduce it nearly to zero with only a small (\$\textbackslash sim\$2\%) drop in test accuracy. In contrast, regularizing to increase class selectivity significantly decreased test accuracy across all models and datasets. These results indicate that class selectivity in individual units is neither sufficient nor strictly necessary, and can even impair DNN performance. They also encourage caution when focusing on the properties of single units as representative of the mechanisms by which DNNs function.},

We apply WaveMAP to extracellular waveforms recorded from dorsal premotor cortex of macaque monkeys performing a decision-making task. Using WaveMAP, we robustly establish eight waveform clusters and show that these clusters recapitulate previously identified narrow- and broad-spiking types while revealing previously unknown diversity within these subtypes. The eight clusters exhibited distinct laminar distributions, characteristic firing rate patterns, and decision-related dynamics. Such insights were weaker when using feature-based approaches. WaveMAP therefore provides a more nuanced understanding of the dynamics of cell types in cortical circuits.},

We combined pharmacological and genetic approaches in the awake mouse olfactory bulb to show that gamma oscillations required the synaptic interplay between excitatory output neurons and inhibitory interneurons. Gamma oscillations were amplified, or abolished, after optogenetic activation or selective lesions to the bulbar output neurons. In response to a moderate increase of the excitation/inhibition ratio in output neurons, long-range gamma synchronization was selectively enhanced while the mean firing activity and the amplitude of inhibitory inputs both remained unchanged in output neurons. This excitation/inhibition imbalance also impaired odor discrimination in an olfactory learning task, suggesting that proper fast neuronal synchronization may be critical for the correct discrimination of similar sensory stimuli.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Using intracellular injection of horseradish peroxidase, the present study analyzes the projections of these three neuronal subclasses to the various subdivisions of the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVON) and to the different cell types found therein. The average number of swellings and number of cells contacted decreased from low- to medium- to high-SR groups. However, these differences in terminal elaboration were not evenly distributed throughout the AVCN. The small cell cap was almost exclusively innervated by low- and medium-SR fibers, i.e., those with the highest acoustic thresholds. Within anterior AVCN, spherical-cell innervation was seen from all SR groups, whereas almost all multipolar cell innervation was from low- and medium-SR fibers. In the posterior AVCN, multipolar-cell innervation was equally likely from all SR groups, whereas globular cells were preferentially contacted by high-SR fibers. These SR-based trends in cochlear nucleus innervation help explain some of the known physiological properties of cell-types in each subdivision. They also suggest that additional physiological study of the small cell cap may be key in elucidating the functional significance of the low-SR population.},

An important component of the system mediating this impressive dynamic range is established in the cochlear sensory epithelium, where functional subtypes of cochlear nerve fibers differ in threshold sensitivity, and spontaneous discharge rate (SR), by more than a factor of 1000 (Liberman, 1978), even though, regardless of type, each fiber contacts only a single hair cell via a single ribbon synapse. To study the mechanisms underlying this remarkable heterogeneity in threshold sensitivity among the 5\textendash 30 primary sensory fibers innervating a single inner hair cell, we quantified the sizes of presynaptic ribbons and postsynaptic AMPA receptor patches in {$>$}1200 synapses, using high-power confocal imaging of mouse cochleas immunostained for CtBP2 (C-terminal binding protein 2, a major ribbon protein) and GluR2/3 (glutamate receptors 2 and 3). We document complementary gradients, most striking in mid-cochlear regions, whereby synapses from the modiolar face and/or basal pole of the inner hair cell have larger ribbons and smaller receptor patches than synapses located in opposite regions of the cell. The AMPA receptor expression gradient likely contributes to the differences in cochlear nerve threshold and SR seen on the two sides of the hair cell in vivo (Liberman, 1982a); the differences in ribbon size may contribute to the heterogeneity of EPSC waveforms seen in vitro (Grant et al., 2010).},

We show that activated microglia induce A1 astrocytes by secreting Il-1{$\alpha$}, TNF and C1q, and that these cytokines together are necessary and sufficient to induce A1 astrocytes. A1 astrocytes lose the ability to promote neuronal survival, outgrowth, synaptogenesis and phagocytosis, and induce the death of neurons and oligodendrocytes. Death of axotomized CNS neurons in vivo is prevented when the formation of A1 astrocytes is blocked. Finally, we show that A1 astrocytes are abundant in various human neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's, Huntington's and Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis. Taken together these findings help to explain why CNS neurons die after axotomy, strongly suggest that A1 astrocytes contribute to the death of neurons and oligodendrocytes in neurodegenerative disorders, and provide opportunities for the development of new treatments for these diseases.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}p{$>$}Natural odorants are complex mixtures of diverse chemical compounds. Monomolecular odorants are represented in the main olfactory bulb by distinct spatial patterns of activated glomeruli. However, it remains unclear how individual compounds contribute to population representations of natural stimuli, which appear to be unexpectedly sparse. We combined gas chromatography and intrinsic signal imaging to visualize glomerular responses to natural stimuli and their fractionated components. While whole stimuli activated up to 20 visible glomeruli, each fractionated component activated only one or few glomeruli, and most glomeruli were activated by only one component. Thus, responses to complex mixtures reflected activation by multiple components, with each contributing only a small part of the overall representation. We conclude that the population response to a complex stimulus is largely the sum of the responses to its individual components, and activation of an individual glomerulus independently signals the presence of a specific component.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Single-cell transcriptomic approaches are revolutionizing neuroscience. Integrating this wealth of data with morphology and physiology, for the comprehensive study of neuronal biology, requires multiplexing gene expression data with complementary techniques. To meet this need, multiple groups in parallel have developed ``Patch-seq,'' a modification of whole-cell patch-clamp protocols that enables mRNA sequencing of cell contents after electrophysiological recordings from individual neurons and morphologic reconstruction of the same cells. In this review, we first outline the critical technical developments that enabled robust Patch-seq experimental efforts and analytical solutions to interpret the rich multimodal data generated. We then review recent applications of Patch-seq that address novel and long-standing questions in neuroscience. These include the following: (1) targeted study of specific neuronal populations based on their anatomic location, functional properties, lineage, or a combination of these factors; (2) the compilation and integration of multimodal cell type atlases; and (3) the investigation of the molecular basis of morphologic and functional diversity. Finally, we highlight potential opportunities for further technical development and lines of research that may benefit from implementing the Patch-seq technique. As a multimodal approach at the intersection of molecular neurobiology and physiology, Patch-seq is uniquely positioned to directly link gene expression to brain function.},

MCTs enable glia to secrete and neurons to absorb lactate, which is converted to pyruvate and acetyl-CoA in neurons. Lactate metabolites provide a substrate for synthesis of fatty acids, which are processed and transferred to glia by FATP and apolipoproteins. In the presence of high ROS, inhibiting lactate transfer or lowering FATP or apolipoprotein levels decreases glial LD accumulation in flies and in primary mouse glial-neuronal cultures. We show that human APOE can substitute for a fly glial apolipoprotein and that APOE4, an Alzheimer's disease susceptibility allele, is impaired in lipid transport and promotes neurodegeneration, providing insights into disease mechanisms.},

Mental health research and care have yet to realize similar advances from MRI. A primary challenge has been replicating associations between inter-individual differences in brain structure~or~function and complex cognitive or mental health phenotypes (brain-wide association studies (BWAS)). Such BWAS have typically relied on sample sizes appropriate for classical brain mapping4 (the median neuroimaging study sample size is about 25), but potentially too small for capturing reproducible brain\textendash behavioural phenotype associations5,6. Here we used three of the largest neuroimaging datasets currently available\textemdash with a total sample size of around 50,000 individuals\textemdash to quantify BWAS effect sizes and reproducibility as a function of sample size. BWAS associations were smaller than previously thought, resulting in statistically underpowered studies, inflated effect sizes and replication failures at typical sample sizes. As sample sizes grew into the thousands, replication rates began to improve and effect size inflation decreased. More robust BWAS effects were detected for functional MRI (versus structural), cognitive tests (versus mental health questionnaires) and multivariate methods (versus univariate). Smaller than expected brain\textendash phenotype associations and variability across population subsamples can explain widespread BWAS replication failures. In contrast to non-BWAS approaches with larger effects (for example, lesions, interventions and within-person), BWAS reproducibility requires samples with thousands of individuals.},

  abstract = {Voluntary movement requires communication from cortex to the spinal cord, where a dedicated pool of motor units (MUs) activates each muscle. The canonical description of MU function, established decades ago, rests upon two foundational tenets. First, cortex cannot control MUs independently1 but supplies each pool with a common drive that specifies force amplitude2,3. Second, as force rises, MUs are recruited in a consistent order4\textendash 13 typically described by Henneman's size principle14\textendash 19. While this paradigm has considerable empirical support, a direct test requires simultaneous observations of many MUs over a range of behaviors. We developed an isometric task that allowed stable MU recordings during rapidly changing force production. MU responses were surprisingly flexible and behavior-dependent. MU activity could not be accurately described as reflecting common drive, even when fit with highly expressive latent factor models. Neuropixels probe recordings revealed that, consistent with the requirements of fully flexible control, the cortical population response displays a surprisingly large number of degrees of freedom. Furthermore, MUs were differentially recruited by microstimulation at neighboring cortical sites. Thus, MU activities are flexibly controlled to meet task demands, and cortex has the capacity to contribute to that ability.},

Here, we analysed 80,660 single-nucleus transcriptomes from the prefrontal cortex of 48 individuals with varying degrees of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Across six major brain cell types, we identified transcriptionally distinct subpopulations, including those associated with pathology and characterized by regulators of myelination, inflammation, and neuron survival. The strongest disease-associated changes appeared early in pathological progression and were highly cell-type specific, whereas genes upregulated at late stages were common across cell types and primarily involved in the global stress response. Notably, we found that female cells were overrepresented in disease-associated subpopulations, and that transcriptional responses were substantially different between sexes in several cell types, including oligodendrocytes. Overall, myelination-related processes were recurrently perturbed in multiple cell types, suggesting that myelination has a key role in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. Our single-cell transcriptomic resource provides a blueprint for interrogating the molecular and cellular basis of Alzheimer's disease.},

Across several experiments, we found that both tamarins and marmosets preferred slow tempos to fast. It is possible that the observed preferences were due to arousal, and that this effect is homologous to the human response to tempo. In other respects, however, these two monkey species showed striking differences compared to humans. Specifically, when presented with a choice between slow tempo musical stimuli, including lullabies, and silence, tamarins and marmosets preferred silence whereas humans, when similarly tested, preferred music. Thus despite the possibility of homologous mechanisms for tempo perception in human and nonhuman primates, there appear to be motivational ties to music that are uniquely human.},

A possible explanation for these results is that sensory cortex implements attractor dynamics, although this proposal remains controversial. Here we report that fast attractor dynamics emerge naturally in a computational model of a patch of primary visual cortex endowed with realistic plasticity (at both feedforward and lateral synapses) and mutual inhibition. When exposed to natural images (but not random pixels), the model spontaneously arranges into competitive groups of reciprocally connected, similarly tuned neurons, while developing realistic, orientation-selective receptive fields. Importantly, the same groups are observed in both stimulus-evoked and spontaneous (stimulus-absent) activity. The resulting network is inhibition-stabilized and exhibits fast, non-persistent attractor dynamics. Our results suggest that realistic plasticity, mutual inhibition and natural stimuli are jointly necessary and sufficient to generate attractor dynamics in primary sensory cortex.},

Presentation of visual stimuli evoked local field potentials from the electrode. Consistent with fMRI, the potentials were larger for chromatic than achromatic stimuli. The potentials differed depending on stimulus color, with blue-purple colors evoking the largest response. The spatial receptive field of the electrode was central/parafoveal with a contralateral bias. In the absence of a visual stimulus, electrical stimulation of the electrode produced an artificial visual percept of a blue-purple color near the center of gaze.

In the present study, we used stimuli evenly distributed on the CIE-xy chromaticity diagram to examine how luminance contrast affects neural representation of color in V4 and the anterior inferior temporal (AITC) and posterior inferior temporal (PITC) color areas (Banno et al., 2011). The activities of single neurons were recorded from monkeys performing a visual fixation task, and the effects of luminance contrast on the color selectivity of individual neurons and their population responses were systematically examined by comparing responses to color stimuli that were brighter or darker than the background. We found that the effects of luminance contrast differed considerably across V4 and the PITC and AITC. In both V4 and the PITC, the effects of luminance contrast on the population responses of color-selective neurons depended on color. In V4, the size of the effect was largest for blue and cyan, whereas in the PITC, the effect gradually increased as the saturation of the color stimulus was reduced, and was especially large with neutral colors (white, gray, black). The pattern observed in the PITC resembles the effect of luminance contrast on color appearance, suggesting PITC neurons are closely involved in the formation of the perceived appearance of color. By contrast, the color selectivities of AITC neurons were little affected by luminance contrast, indicating that hue and saturation of color stimuli are represented independently of luminance contrast in the AITC.},

Previously, we found that V4 neurons selective for curved elements exhibit a high degree of spatial variation in their preference. If spatial variation in curvature selectivity was also marked by distinct temporal response patterns at different spatial locations, then it might be possible to untangle this information in subsequent processing based on temporal responses. Indeed, we find that V4 neurons whose receptive fields exhibit intricate selectivity also show variation in their temporal responses across locations. A computational model that decodes stimulus identity based on population responses benefits from using this temporal information, suggesting that it could provide a multiplexed code for spatio-temporal features.},

In contrast, most work in artificial agents has focused on learning a single complex problem in a static environment.

Like conventional NNs, SNNs can be trained on real, domain-specific data; however, their training requires the overcoming of a number of challenges linked to their binary and dynamical nature. This article elucidates step-by-step the problems typically encountered when training SNNs and guides the reader through the key concepts of synaptic plasticity and data-driven learning in the spiking setting. Accordingly, it gives an overview of existing approaches and provides an introduction to surrogate gradient (SG) methods, specifically, as a particularly flexible and efficient method to overcome the aforementioned challenges.},

These insights are then generalized. A priori, there is no privileged level of causation. The relations between this form of `biological relativity' and forms of relativity in physics are discussed. Biological relativity can be seen as an extension of the relativity principle by avoiding the assumption that there is a privileged scale at which biological functions are determined.},

  abstract = {Very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) exert a variety of cellular functions and are associated with numerous diseases. However, the precise pathway behind their elongation has remained elusive. Moreover, few regulatory mechanisms for VLCFAs synthesis have been identified. Elongases catalyze the first of four steps in the VLCFA elongation cycle; mammals have seven elongases (ELOVL1\textendash 7). In the present study, we determined the precise substrate specificities of all the ELOVLs by in vitro analyses. Particularly notable was the high activity exhibited by ELOVL1 toward saturated and monounsaturated C20- and C22-CoAs, and that it was essential for the production of C24 sphingolipids, which are unique in their capacity to interdigitate within the membrane as a result of their long chain length. We further established that ELOVL1 activity is regulated with the ceramide synthase CERS2, an enzyme essential for C24 sphingolipid synthesis. This regulation may ensure that the production of C24-CoA by elongation is coordinated with its utilization. Finally, knockdown of ELOVL1 caused a reduction in the activity of the Src kinase LYN, confirming that C24-sphingolipids are particularly important in membrane microdomain function.},

  abstract = {Biological neural networks define the brain function and intelligence of humans and other mammals, and form ultra-large, spatial, structured graphs. Their neuronal organization is closely interconnected with the spatial organization of the brain's microvasculature, which supplies oxygen to the neurons and builds a complementary spatial graph. This vasculature (or the vessel structure) plays an important role in neuroscience; for example, the organization of (and changes to) vessel structure can represent early signs of various pathologies, e.g. Alzheimer's disease or stroke. Recently, advances in tissue clearing have enabled whole brain imaging and segmentation of the entirety of the mouse brain's vasculature. Building on these advances in imaging, we are presenting an extendable dataset of whole-brain vessel graphs based on specific imaging protocols. Specifically, we extract vascular graphs using a refined graph extraction scheme leveraging the volume rendering engine Voreen and provide them in an accessible and adaptable form through the OGB and PyTorch Geometric dataloaders. Moreover, we benchmark numerous state-of-the-art graph learning algorithms on the biologically relevant tasks of vessel prediction and vessel classification using the introduced vessel graph dataset. Our work paves a path towards advancing graph learning research into the field of neuroscience. Complementarily, the presented dataset raises challenging graph learning research questions for the machine learning community, in terms of incorporating biological priors into learning algorithms, or in scaling these algorithms to handle sparse,spatial graphs with millions of nodes and edges.

  abstract = {Braak stages of tau neurofibrillary tangle accumulation have been incorporated in the criteria for the neuropathological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. It is expected that Braak staging using brain imaging can stratify living individuals according to their individual patterns of tau deposition, which may prove crucial for clinical trials and practice. However, previous studies using the first-generation tau PET agents have shown a low sensitivity to detect tau pathology in areas corresponding to early Braak histopathological stages ({$\sim$}20\% of cognitively unimpaired elderly with tau deposition in regions corresponding to Braak I\textendash II), in contrast to {$\sim$}80\textendash 90\% reported in post-mortem cohorts. Here, we tested whether the novel high affinity tau tangles tracer 18F-MK-6240 can better identify individuals in the early stages of tau accumulation. To this end, we studied 301 individuals (30 cognitively unimpaired young, 138 cognitively unimpaired elderly, 67 with mild cognitive impairment, 54 with Alzheimer's disease dementia, and 12 with frontotemporal dementia) with amyloid-{$\beta$} 18F-NAV4694, tau 18F-MK-6240, MRI, and clinical assessments. 18F-MK-6240 standardized uptake value ratio images were acquired at 90\textendash 110 min after the tracer injection. 18F-MK-6240 discriminated Alzheimer's disease dementia from mild cognitive impairment and frontotemporal dementia with high accuracy ({$\sim$}85\textendash 100\%). 18F-MK-6240 recapitulated topographical patterns consistent with the six hierarchical stages proposed by Braak in 98\% of our population. Cognition and amyloid-{$\beta$} status explained most of the Braak stages variance (P\,\&lt;\,0.0001, R2 = 0.75). No single region of interest standardized uptake value ratio accurately segregated individuals into the six topographic Braak stages. Sixty-eight per cent of the cognitively unimpaired elderly amyloid-{$\beta$}-positive and 37\% of the cognitively unimpaired elderly amyloid-{$\beta$}-negative subjects displayed tau deposition, at least in the transentorhinal cortex (Braak I). Tau deposition solely in the transentorhinal cortex was associated with an elevated prevalence of amyloid-{$\beta$}, neurodegeneration, and cognitive impairment (P\,\&lt;\,0.0001). 18F-MK-6240 deposition in regions corresponding to Braak IV\textendash VI was associated with the highest prevalence of neurodegeneration, whereas in Braak V\textendash VI regions with the highest prevalence of cognitive impairment. Our results suggest that the hierarchical six-stage Braak model using 18F-MK-6240 imaging provides an index of early and late tau accumulation as well as disease stage in preclinical and symptomatic individuals. Tau PET Braak staging using high affinity tracers has the potential to be incorporated in the diagnosis of living patients with Alzheimer's disease in the near future.},

  abstract = {Visual shape recognition in primates depends on a multi-stage pathway running from primary visual cortex (V1) to inferotemporal cortex (IT). The mechanisms by which local shape signals from V1 are transformed into selectivity for abstract object categories in IT are unknown. One approach to this issue is to investigate shape representation at intermediate stages in the pathway, such as area V4. We studied 109 V4 cells that appeared sensitive to complex shape in preliminary tests. To achieve a more complete picture of shape representation in V4, we tested each cell with a set of 366 stimuli, constructed by systematically combining convex and concave boundary elements into closed shapes. Using this large, diverse stimulus set, we found that all the cells in our sample responded to a wide variety of shapes and did not appear to encode any single type of global shape. However, for most cells the shapes evoking strongest responses were characterized by a consistent type of boundary conformation at a specific position within the stimulus. For example, a given cell might be tuned for shapes containing concave curvature at the right, with other parts of the shape having little or no effect on responses. Many cells were tuned for more complex boundary configurations (e.g., a convex angle adjacent to a concave curve). We quantified this kind of shape tuning with Gaussian functions on a curvature \texttimes{} position domain. These tuning functions fit the neural responses much better than tuning functions based on edge or axis orientation. Thus individual V4 cells appear to encode moderately complex boundary information at specific locations within larger shapes. This finding suggests that, at intermediate stages in the V1-IT transformation, complex objects are represented at least partly in terms of the configurations and positions of their contour components.}

V4 is extensively interconnected with other visual cortical areas along the ventral and dorsal visual streams, with frontal cortical areas, and with several subcortical structures. Thus, it is well poised to play a broad and integrative role in visual perception and recognition-the functional domain of the ventral pathway. Neurophysiological studies in monkeys engaged in passive fixation and behavioral tasks suggest that V4 responses are dictated by tuning in a high-dimensional stimulus space defined by form, texture, color, depth, and other attributes of visual stimuli. This high-dimensional tuning may underlie the development of object-based representations in the visual cortex that are critical for tracking, recognizing, and interacting with objects. Neurophysiological and lesion studies also suggest that V4 responses are important for guiding perceptual decisions and higher-order behavior.},

  abstract = {Mounting evidence suggests that musical training benefits the neural encoding of speech. This paper offers a hypothesis specifying why such benefits occur. The ``OPERA'' hypothesis proposes that such benefits are driven by adaptive plasticity in speech-processing networks, and that this plasticity occurs when five conditions are met. These are: (1) Overlap: there is anatomical overlap in the brain networks that process an acoustic feature used in both music and speech (e.g., waveform periodicity, amplitude envelope), (2) Precision: music places higher demands on these shared networks than does speech, in terms of the precision of processing, (3) Emotion: the musical activities that engage this network elicit strong positive emotion, (4) Repetition: the musical activities that engage this network are frequently repeated, and (5) Attention: the musical activities that engage this network are associated with focused attention. According to the OPERA hypothesis, when these conditions are met neural plasticity drives the networks in question to function with higher precision than needed for ordinary speech communication. Yet since speech shares these networks with music, speech processing benefits. The OPERA hypothesis is used to account for the observed superior subcortical encoding of speech in musically trained individuals, and to suggest mechanisms by which musical training might improve linguistic reading abilities.}

However, models that rely solely on pre- and postsynaptic activity for synaptic changes have, so far, not been able to account for learning complex tasks that demand credit assignment in hierarchical networks. Here we show that if synaptic plasticity is regulated by high-frequency bursts of spikes, then pyramidal neurons higher in a hierarchical circuit can coordinate the plasticity of lower-level connections. Using simulations and mathematical analyses, we demonstrate that, when paired with short-term synaptic dynamics, regenerative activity in the apical dendrites and synaptic plasticity in feedback pathways, a burst-dependent learning rule can solve challenging tasks that require deep network architectures. Our results demonstrate that well-known properties of dendrites, synapses and synaptic plasticity are sufficient to enable sophisticated learning in hierarchical circuits.},

Pyramidal findings are present; deep tendon reflexes are brisk early on and absent later in the course. Age of onset is typically in the fourth decade with a ten- to 15-year disease duration., The diagnosis of SCA2 rests on the use of molecular genetic testing to detect an abnormal CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in ATXN2. Affected individuals have alleles with 33 or more CAG trinucleotide repeats., Treatment of manifestations: Management is supportive. Affected individuals should maintain activity. Canes and walkers help prevent falls; grab bars, raised toilet seats, and ramps to accommodate motorized chairs may be necessary. Speech therapy and communication devices such as writing pads and computer-based devices may benefit those with dysarthria. Weighted eating utensils and dressing hooks help maintain a sense of independence. When dysphagia becomes troublesome, video swallowing studies can identify the consistency of food least likely to trigger aspiration. Prevention of secondary complications: Vitamin supplements are recommended; weight control helps minimize difficulties with ambulation and mobility. Surveillance: Annual examination by a physician experienced in movement disorders and ataxia. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Alcohol and medications known to affect cerebellar function., SCA2 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Offspring of an affected individual have a 50\% chance of inheriting the causative CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion. The repeat may expand significantly, especially when transmitted by the father. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the diagnosis has been established by molecular genetic testing in an affected family member.},

These linking hypotheses are in need of neurobiological justification and explanation. Recent mathematical models of human language mechanisms constrained by fundamental neuroscience principles and established knowledge about comparative neuroanatomy offer explanations for where, when and how language is processed in the human brain. In these models, network structure and connectivity along with action- and perception-induced correlation of neuronal activity co-determine neurocognitive mechanisms. Language learning leads to the formation of action perception circuits (APCs) with specific distributions across cortical areas. Cognitive and linguistic processes such as speech production, comprehension, verbal working memory and prediction are modelled by activity dynamics in these APCs, and combinatorial and communicative-interactive knowledge is organized in the dynamics within, and connections between APCs. The network models and, in particular, the concept of distributionally-specific circuits, can account for some previously not well understood facts about the cortical `hubs' for semantic processing and the motor system's role in language understanding and speech sound recognition. A review of experimental data evaluates predictions of the APC model and alternative theories, also providing detailed discussion of some seemingly contradictory findings. Throughout, recent disputes about the role of mirror neurons and grounded cognition in language and communication are assessed critically.},

However, the cell-type-specific mechanism of ApoE4 in modulating brain lipid metabolism is unclear. Here, we describe a detrimental role of ApoE4 in regulating fatty acid (FA) metabolism across neuron and astrocyte in tandem with their distinctive mitochondrial phenotypes. ApoE4 disrupts neuronal function by decreasing FA sequestering in lipid droplets (LDs). FAs in neuronal LDs are exported and internalized by astrocytes, with ApoE4 diminishing the transport efficiency. Further, ApoE4 lowers FA oxidation and leads to lipid accumulation in both astrocyte and the hippocampus. Importantly, diminished capacity of ApoE4 astrocytes in eliminating neuronal lipids and degrading FAs accounts for their compromised metabolic and synaptic support to neurons. Collectively, our findings reveal a mechanism of ApoE4 disruption to brain FA and bioenergetic homeostasis that could underlie the accelerated lipid dysregulation and energy deficits and increased AD risk for ApoE4 carriers.},

We use this process, called Partial In-Network Training (PINning), to model and match cellular resolution imaging data from the posterior parietal cortex during a virtual memory-guided two-alternative forced-choice task. Analysis of the connectivity reveals that sequences propagate by the cooperation between recurrent synaptic interactions and external inputs, rather than through feedforward or asymmetric connections.

These advances are largely aimed at enabling us to understand how neural circuit computations mechanistically cause behavior. Here, using techniques from Theoretical Computer Science, we examine how many experiments are needed to obtain such an empirical understanding. It is proved, mathematically, that establishing the most extensive notions of understanding need exponentially-many experiments in the number of neurons, in general, unless a widely-posited hypothesis about computation is false. Worse still, the feasible experimental regime is one where the number of experiments scales sub-linearly in the number of neurons, suggesting a fundamental impediment to such an understanding. Determining which notions of understanding are algorithmically tractable, thus, becomes an important new endeavor in Neuroscience.},

  abstract = {Fatty acids (FAs) provide cellular energy under starvation, yet how they mobilize and move into mitochondria in starved cells, driving oxidative respiration, is unclear. Here, we clarify this process by visualizing FA trafficking with a fluorescent FA probe. The labeled FA accumulated in lipid droplets (LDs) in well-fed cells but moved from LDs into mitochondria when cells were starved. Autophagy in starved cells replenished LDs with FAs, increasing LD number over time. Cytoplasmic lipases removed FAs from LDs, enabling their transfer into mitochondria. This required mitochondria to be highly fused and localized near LDs. When mitochondrial fusion was prevented in starved cells, FAs neither homogeneously distributed within mitochondria nor became efficiently metabolized. Instead, FAs reassociated with LDs and fluxed into neighboring cells. Thus, FAs engage in complex trafficking itineraries regulated by cytoplasmic lipases, autophagy, and mitochondrial fusion dynamics, ensuring maximum oxidative metabolism and avoidance of FA toxicity in starved cells.},

What is unclear, however, is whether this capacity depends on a unique constellation of perceptual and neurobiological mechanisms or whether a subset of such mechanisms is shared with other organisms. To explore this problem, parallel experiments were conducted on human newborns and cotton-top tamarin monkeys to assess their ability to discriminate unfamiliar languages. A habituation-dishabituation procedure was used to show that human newborns and tamarins can discriminate sentences from Dutch and Japanese but not if the sentences are played backward. Moreover, the cues for discrimination are not present in backward speech. This suggests that the human newborns' tuning to certain properties of speech relies on general processes of the primate auditory system.},

Microstimulation of OPN stops saccades in mid-flight, which shows that OPN can end saccades. However, OPN pause duration does not correlate well with saccade duration, and saccades are normometric after OPN lesions. We tested whether OPN were responsible for stopping saccades both in late-onset Tay-Sachs, which causes premature saccadic termination, and in individuals with cerebellar hypermetria. We studied gaze shifts between two targets at different distances aligned on one eye, which consist of a disjunctive saccade followed by vergence. High-frequency conjugate oscillations during the vergence movements that followed saccades were present in all subjects studied, indicating OPN silence. Thus, mechanisms other than OPN discharge (e.g., cerebellar caudal fastigial nucleus-promoting inhibitory BN discharge) must contribute to saccade termination.},

  abstract = {The color of an object, when part of a complex scene, is determined not only by its spectral reflectance but also by the colors of all other objects in the scene (von Helmholtz, 1886; Ives, 1912; Land, 1959). By taking global color information into account, the visual system is able to maintain constancy of the color appearance of the object, despite large variations in the light incident on the retina arising from changes in the spectral content of the illuminating light (Hurlbert, 1998; Maloney, 1999). The neural basis of this color constancy is, however, poorly understood. Although there seems to be a prominent role for retinal, cone-specific adaptation mechanisms (von Kries, 1902; P\"oppel, 1986; Foster and Nascimento, 1994), the contribution of cortical mechanisms to color constancy is still unclear (Land et al., 1983; D'Zmura and Lennie, 1986). We examined the color perception of 27 patients with defined unilateral lesions mainly located in the parieto-temporo-occipital and fronto-parieto-temporal cortex. With a battery of clinical and specially designed color vision tests we tried to detect and differentiate between possible deficits in central color processing. Our results show that color constancy can be selectively impaired after circumscribed unilateral lesions in parieto-temporal cortex of the left or right hemisphere. Five of 27 patients exhibited significant deficits in a color constancy task, but all of the 5 performed well in color discrimination or higher-level visual tasks, such as the association of colors with familiar objects. These results indicate that the computations underlying color constancy are mediated by specialized cortical circuitry, which is independent of the neural substrate for color discrimination and for assigning colors to objects.},

However, high-gain excitatory networks are susceptible to instability, which can lead to runaway activity, as manifested in pathological regimes such as epilepsy. Inhibitory stabilization offers a dynamic, fast and flexible compensatory mechanism to balance otherwise unstable networks, thus enabling the brain to operate in its most efficient regimes. Here we review recent experimental evidence for the presence of such inhibition-stabilized dynamics in the brain and discuss their consequences for cortical computation. We show how the study of inhibition-stabilized networks in the brain has been facilitated by recent advances in the technological toolbox and perturbative techniques, as well as a concomitant development of biologically realistic computational models. By outlining future avenues, we suggest that inhibitory stabilization can offer an exemplary case of how experimental neuroscience can progress in tandem with technology and theory to advance our understanding of the brain.},

Recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence research have opened up new ways of thinking about neural computation. Many researchers are excited by the possibility that deep neural networks may offer theories of perception, cognition and action for biological brains. This approach has the potential to radically reshape our approach to understanding neural systems, because the computations performed by deep networks are learned from experience, and not endowed by the researcher. If so, how can neuroscientists use deep networks to model and understand biological brains? What is the outlook for neuroscientists who seek to characterize computations or neural codes, or who wish to understand perception, attention, memory and executive functions? In this Perspective, our goal is to offer a road map for systems neuroscience research in the age of deep learning. We discuss the conceptual and methodological challenges of comparing behaviour, learning dynamics and neural representations in artificial and biological systems, and we highlight new research questions that have emerged for neuroscience as a direct consequence of recent advances in machine learning.},

Here we used Patch-seq8 to combine patch-clamp recording, biocytin staining, and single-cell RNA sequencing of more than 1,300 neurons in adult mouse primary motor cortex, providing a morpho-electric annotation of almost all transcriptomically defined neural cell types. We found that, although broad families of transcriptomic types (those expressing Vip, Pvalb, Sst and so on) had distinct and essentially non-overlapping morpho-electric phenotypes, individual transcriptomic types within the same family were not well separated in the morpho-electric space. Instead, there was a continuum of variability in morphology and electrophysiology, with neighbouring transcriptomic cell types showing similar morpho-electric features, often without clear boundaries between them. Our results suggest that neuronal types in the neocortex do not always form discrete entities. Instead, neurons form a hierarchy that consists of distinct non-overlapping branches at the level of families, but can form continuous and correlated transcriptomic and morpho-electrical landscapes within families.},

Consistent with this view, fMRI has revealed cortical regions that respond selectively to certain stimulus classes such as faces. However, results from multivoxel pattern analyses (MVPA) challenge this view by demonstrating that category-selective regions often contain information about ``nonpreferred'' stimulus dimensions. But is this nonpreferred information causally relevant to behavior? Here we report a rare opportunity to test this question in a neurosurgical patient implanted for clinical reasons with strips of electrodes along his fusiform gyri. Broadband gamma electrocorticographic responses in multiple adjacent electrodes showed strong selectivity for faces in a region corresponding to the fusiform face area (FFA), and preferential responses to color in a nearby site, replicating earlier reports. To test the causal role of these regions in the perception of nonpreferred dimensions, we then electrically stimulated individual sites while the patient viewed various objects. When stimulated in the FFA, the patient reported seeing an illusory face (or ``facephene''), independent of the object viewed. Similarly, stimulation of color-preferring sites produced illusory ``rainbows.'' Crucially, the patient reported no change in the object viewed, apart from the facephenes and rainbows apparently superimposed on them. The functional and anatomical specificity of these effects indicate that some cortical regions are exclusively causally engaged in a single specific mental process, and prompt caution about the widespread assumption that any information scientists can decode from the brain is causally relevant to behavior.},

Neurons in area V4 are selective for relative disparity, which is the crucial visual cue for discrimination of fine disparity. Here, we investigated the contribution of V4 neurons to fine disparity discrimination. Monkeys discriminated whether the center disk of a dynamic random-dot stereogram was in front of or behind its surrounding annulus. We first behaviorally tested the reference frame of the disparity representation used for performing this task. After learning the task with a set of surround disparities, the monkey generalized its responses to untrained surround disparities, indicating that the perceptual decisions were generated from a disparity representation in a relative frame of reference. We then recorded single-unit responses from V4 while the monkeys performed the task. On average, neuronal thresholds were higher than the behavioral thresholds. The most sensitive neurons reached thresholds as low as the psychophysical thresholds. For subthreshold disparities, the monkeys made frequent errors. The variable decisions were predictable from the fluctuation in the neuronal responses. The predictions were based on a decision model in which each V4 neuron transmits the evidence for the disparity it prefers. We finally altered the disparity representation artificially by means of microstimulation to V4. The decisions were systematically biased when microstimulation boosted the V4 responses. The bias was toward the direction predicted from the decision model. We suggest that disparity signals carried by V4 neurons underlie precise discrimination of fine stereoscopic depth.},

  abstract = {The anatomy of the mammalian visual system, from the retina to the neocortex, is organized hierarchically1. However, direct observation of cellular-level functional interactions across this hierarchy is lacking due to the challenge of simultaneously recording activity across numerous regions. Here we describe a large, open dataset\textemdash part of the Allen Brain Observatory2\textemdash that surveys spiking from tens of thousands of units in six cortical and two thalamic regions in the brains of mice responding to a battery of visual stimuli. Using cross-correlation analysis, we reveal that the organization of inter-area functional connectivity during visual stimulation mirrors the anatomical hierarchy from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas3. We find that four classical hierarchical measures\textemdash response latency, receptive-field size, phase-locking to drifting gratings and response decay timescale\textemdash are all correlated with the hierarchy. Moreover, recordings obtained during a visual task reveal that the correlation between neural activity and behavioural choice also increases along the hierarchy. Our study provides a foundation for understanding coding and signal propagation across hierarchically organized cortical and thalamic visual areas.},

We show that music has adaptive value through emotional contagion, social cohesion, and improved well-being. We trace the roots of music through the emotional signals of other species suggesting that the emotional aspects of music have a long evolutionary history. We show how music and speech are closely interlinked with the musical aspects of speech conveying emotional information. We describe acoustic structures that communicate emotion in music and present evidence that these emotional features are widespread among humans and also function to induce emotions in animals. Similar acoustic structures are present in the emotional signals of nonhuman animals. We conclude with a discussion of music designed specifically to induce emotional states in animals.},

Other species may incorporate similar emotional features into their calls as we use to induce emotions in music Animal calls not only communicate a caller's emotional state but may also induce emotional responses in listeners.

They contiguously tile the entire central nervous system (CNS) and exert many essential complex functions in the healthy CNS. Astrocytes respond to all forms of CNS insults through a process referred to as reactive astrogliosis, which has become a pathological hallmark of CNS structural lesions. Substantial progress has been made recently in determining functions and mechanisms of reactive astrogliosis and in identifying roles of astrocytes in CNS disorders and pathologies. A vast molecular arsenal at the disposal of reactive astrocytes is being defined. Transgenic mouse models are dissecting specific aspects of reactive astrocytosis and glial scar formation in vivo. Astrocyte involvement in specific clinicopathological entities is being defined. It is now clear that reactive astrogliosis is not a simple all-or-none phenomenon but is a finely gradated continuum of changes that occur in context-dependent manners regulated by specific signaling events. These changes range from reversible alterations in gene expression and cell hypertrophy with preservation of cellular domains and tissue structure, to long-lasting scar formation with rearrangement of tissue structure. Increasing evidence points towards the potential of reactive astrogliosis to play either primary or contributing roles in CNS disorders via loss of normal astrocyte functions or gain of abnormal effects. This article reviews (1) astrocyte functions in healthy CNS, (2) mechanisms and functions of reactive astrogliosis and glial scar formation, and (3) ways in which reactive astrocytes may cause or contribute to specific CNS disorders and lesions.},

Whether the underlying mechanisms of pitch perception are unique to humans, however, is unknown. Based on estimates of frequency resolution at the level of the auditory periphery, psychoacoustic studies in humans have revealed several primary features of central pitch mechanisms. It has been shown that (i) pitch strength of a harmonic tone is dominated by resolved harmonics; (ii) pitch of resolved harmonics is sensitive to the quality of spectral harmonicity; and (iii) pitch of unresolved harmonics is sensitive to the salience of temporal envelope cues. Here we show, for a standard musical tuning fundamental frequency of 440 Hz, that the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a New World monkey with a hearing range similar to that of humans, exhibits all of the primary features of central pitch mechanisms demonstrated in humans. Thus, marmosets and humans may share similar pitch perception mechanisms, suggesting that these mechanisms may have emerged early in primate evolution.},

Increasing odor concentrations reduced response latencies, increased response amplitudes, and recruited new glomerular units. However, the sequence of glomerular activation was maintained. Furthermore, we found distributed MOB activity locked to the nasal respiration cycle. The spatial distribution of its amplitude and phase was heterogeneous and changed by sensory input in an odor-specific manner.

It is unclear to what extent the functional specialization of the striatum is due to the molecular specialization of SPN subtypes. We sought to define the molecular and anatomical diversity of adult SPNs using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and quantitative RNA \emph{in situ} hybridization (ISH). We computationally distinguished discrete versus continuous heterogeneity in scRNA-seq data and found that SPNs in the striatum can be classified into four major discrete types with no implied spatial relationship between them. Within these discrete types, we find continuous heterogeneity encoding spatial gradients of gene expression and defining anatomical location in a combinatorial mechanism. Our results suggest that neuronal circuitry has a substructure at far higher resolution than is typically interrogated, which is defined by the precise identity and location of a neuron.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We recorded simultaneously from up to 50,000 neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) and in higher order visual areas and measured stimulus discrimination thresholds of 0.35\textdegree{} and 0.37\textdegree, respectively, in an orientation decoding task. These neural thresholds were almost 100 times smaller than the behavioral discrimination thresholds reported in mice. This discrepancy could not be explained by stimulus properties or arousal states. Furthermore, behavioral variability during a sensory discrimination task could not be explained by neural variability in V1. Instead, behavior-related neural activity arose dynamically across a network of non-sensory brain areas. These results imply that perceptual discrimination in mice is limited by downstream decoders, not by neural noise in sensory representations.},

We report here that a five-month-old human-raised chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) preferred consonant music. The infant chimpanzee consistently preferred to produce, with the aid of our computerized setup, consonant versions of music for a longer duration than dissonant versions.

Using transcriptome analysis of thousands of single neurons, we demonstrate that murine type I SGNs consist of subclasses that are defined by the expression of subsets of transcription factors, cell adhesion molecules, ion channels, and neurotransmitter receptors. Subtype specification is initiated prior to the onset of hearing during the time period when auditory circuits mature. Gene mutations linked to deafness that disrupt hair cell mechanotransduction or glutamatergic signaling perturb the firing behavior of SGNs prior to hearing onset and disrupt SGN subtype specification. We thus conclude that an intact hair cell mechanotransduction machinery is critical during the pre-hearing period to regulate the firing behavior of SGNs and their segregation into subtypes. Because deafness is frequently caused by defects in hair cells, our findings have significant ramifications for the etiology of hearing loss and its treatment.},

Their wide applicability has encouraged researchers to improve artificial neural networks by investigating the biological brain.

New technologies can now capture temporal changes in the internal activity of the brain in more detail and help clarify the relationship between brain activity and the perception of a given stimulus. This new knowledge has led to a new type of artificial neural network, the Spiking Neural Network (SNN), that draws more faithfully on biological properties to provide higher processing abilities. A review of recent developments in learning of spiking neurons is presented in this paper. First the biological background of SNN learning algorithms is reviewed. The important elements of a learning algorithm such as the neuron model, synaptic plasticity, information encoding and SNN topologies are then presented. Then, a critical review of the state-of-the-art learning algorithms for SNNs using single and multiple spikes is presented. Additionally, deep spiking neural networks are reviewed, and challenges and opportunities in the SNN field are discussed.},

  abstract = {It is normally obvious to listeners whether a human vocalization is intended to be heard as speech or song. However, the 2 signals are remarkably similar acoustically. A naturally occurring boundary case between speech and song has been discovered where a spoken phrase sounds as if it were sung when isolated and repeated. In the present study, an extensive search of audiobooks uncovered additional similar examples, which were contrasted with samples from the same corpus that do not sound like song, despite containing clear prosodic pitch contours. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we show that hearing these 2 closely matched stimuli is not associated with differences in response of early auditory areas. Rather, we find that a network of 8 regions, including the anterior superior temporal gyrus (STG) just anterior to Heschl's gyrus and the right midposterior STG, respond more strongly to speech perceived as song than to mere speech. This network overlaps a number of areas previously associated with pitch extraction and song production, confirming that phrases originally intended to be heard as speech can, under certain circumstances, be heard as song. Our results suggest that song processing compared with speech processing makes increased demands on pitch processing and auditory\textendash motor integration.}

When visual features of these objects were partially removed, the simplified stimuli activated only a subset of the patches elicited by the originals. This result, in conjunction with extracellular recording, suggests that an object is represented by a combination of cortical columns, each of which represents a visual feature (feature column). Simplification of an object occasionally caused the appearance of columns that were not active when viewing the more complex form. Thus, not all the columns related to a particular feature were necessarily activated by the original objects. Taken together, these results suggest that objects may be represented not only by simply combining feature columns but also by using a variety of combinations of active and inactive columns for individual features.},

They communicate with neurones and other glial cells through the release of signalling molecules. Astrocytes secrete a wide array of classic neurotransmitters, neuromodulators and hormones, as well as metabolic, trophic and plastic factors, all of which contribute to the gliocrine system. The release of neuroactive substances from astrocytes occurs through several distinct pathways that include diffusion through plasmalemmal channels, translocation by multiple transporters and regulated exocytosis. As in other eukaryotic cells, exocytotic secretion from astrocytes involves divergent secretory organelles (synaptic-like microvesicles, dense-core vesicles, lysosomes, exosomes and ectosomes), which differ in size, origin, cargo, membrane composition, dynamics and functions. In this review, we summarize the features and functions of secretory organelles in astrocytes. We focus on the biogenesis and trafficking of secretory organelles and on the regulation of the exocytotic secretory system in the context of healthy and diseased astrocytes.},

Modulating these astroglia changes may represent a fertile ground for novel therapeutic intervention strategies to prevent, delay progression and/or ameliorate pathology.

For instance, in ``place cell'' literature, place cells are extensively associated with their role in ``the representation of space.'' In spite of its extended use, we still lack a clear, universal and widely accepted view on what it means for a nervous system to represent something, on what makes a neural activity a representation, and on what is re-presented. The lack of a theoretical foundation and definition of the notion has not hindered actual research. My aim here is to identify how active scientists use the notion of neural representation, and eventually to list a set of criteria, based on actual use, that can help in distinguishing between genuine or non-genuine neural-representation candidates. In order to attain this objective, I present first the results of a survey of authors within two domains, place-cell and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) research. Based on the authors' replies, and on a review of neuroscientific research, I outline a set of common properties that an account of neural representation seems to require. I then apply these properties to assess the use of the notion in two domains of the survey, place-cell and MVPA studies. I conclude by exploring a shift in the notion of representation suggested by recent literature.}

In contrast, neurons from the superficial SC layers showed little color-related activity. Crucially, visual onset latencies were 30\textendash 35 ms longer for color, implying that luminance and chrominance information reach the SC through distinct pathways and that the observed color-related activity is not the result of residual luminance signals. Furthermore, these differences in visual onset latency translated directly into differences in saccadic reaction time. The results demonstrate that the saccadic system can signal the presence of chromatic stimuli only one stage from the brainstem premotor circuitry that drives the eyes.},

Here, we measured neural responses and the effects of EBS in primary visual cortex in four patients implanted with intracranial electrodes. Using stimulation, behavior, and retinotopic mapping, we show the relationship between the size of affected cortical area and the magnitude of electrical charge. Furthermore, we show that the spatial location of electrically induced visual sensations is matched to the receptive field of the cortical site measured with broadband field potentials, and less so with event related potentials.

  abstract = {Auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) exhibit a range of spontaneous firing rates (SRs) that are inversely correlated with threshold for sounds. To probe the underlying mechanisms and time course of SR differentiation during cochlear maturation, loose-patch extracellular recordings were made from ANF dendrites using acutely excised rat cochlear preparations of different ages after hearing onset. Diversification of SRs occurred mostly between the second and the third postnatal week. Statistical properties of ANF spike trains showed developmental changes that approach adult-like features in older preparations. Comparison with intracellularly recorded EPSCs revealed that most properties of ANF spike trains derive from the characteristics of presynaptic transmitter release. Pharmacological tests and waveform analysis showed that endogenous firing produces some fraction of ANF spikes, accounting for their unusual properties; the endogenous firing diminishes gradually during maturation. Paired recordings showed that ANFs contacting the same inner hair cell could have different SRs, with no correlation in their spike timing. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The inner hair cell (IHC)/auditory nerve fiber (ANF) synapse is the first synapse of the auditory pathway. Remarkably, each IHC is the sole partner of 10\textendash 30 ANFs with a range of spontaneous firing rates (SRs). Low and high SR ANFs respond to sound differently, and both are important for encoding sound information across varying acoustical environments. Here we demonstrate SR diversification after hearing onset by afferent recordings in acutely excised rat cochlear preparations. We describe developmental changes in spike train statistics and endogenous firing in immature ANFs. Dual afferent recordings provide the first direct evidence that fibers with different SRs contact the same IHCs and do not show correlated spike timing at rest. These results lay the groundwork for understanding the differential sensitivity of ANFs to acoustic trauma.},

Here we show that blockade of NMDAR-dependent bursting activity in the `anti-reward center', the lateral habenula (LHb), mediates the rapid antidepressant actions of ketamine in rat and mouse models of depression. LHb neurons show a significant increase in burst activity and theta-band synchronization in depressive-like animals, which is reversed by ketamine. Burst-evoking photostimulation of LHb drives behavioural despair and anhedonia. Pharmacology and modelling experiments reveal that LHb bursting requires both NMDARs and low-voltage-sensitive T-type calcium channels (T-VSCCs). Furthermore, local blockade of NMDAR or T-VSCCs in the LHb is sufficient to induce rapid antidepressant effects. Our results suggest a simple model whereby ketamine quickly elevates mood by blocking NMDAR-dependent bursting activity of LHb neurons to disinhibit downstream monoaminergic reward centres, and provide a framework for developing new rapid-acting antidepressants.},

  abstract = {Activation of microglia by classical inflammatory mediators can convert astrocytes into a neurotoxic A1 phenotype in a variety of neurological diseases1,2. Development of agents that could inhibit the formation of A1 reactive astrocytes could be used to treat these diseases for which there are no disease-modifying therapies. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) agonists have been indicated as potential neuroprotective agents for neurologic disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease3\textendash 13. The mechanisms by which GLP1R agonists are neuroprotective are not known. Here we show that a potent, brain-penetrant long-acting GLP1R agonist, NLY01, protects against the loss of dopaminergic neurons and behavioral deficits in the {$\alpha$}-synuclein preformed fibril ({$\alpha$}-syn PFF) mouse model of sporadic Parkinson's disease14,15. NLY01 also prolongs the life and reduces the behavioral deficits and neuropathological abnormalities in the human A53T {$\alpha$}-synuclein (hA53T) transgenic mouse model of {$\alpha$}-synucleinopathy-induced neurodegeneration16. We found that NLY01 is a potent GLP1R agonist with favorable properties that is neuroprotective through the direct prevention of microglial-mediated conversion of astrocytes to an A1 neurotoxic phenotype. In light of its favorable properties, NLY01 should be evaluated in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and related neurologic disorders characterized by microglial activation.},

Historically, astrocytes have been studied as a homogeneous group of cells. However, evidence has accumulated that suggests heterogeneity of astrocytes across brain regions as well as within the same brain regions. Astrocytes differ in their morphology, developmental origin, gene expression profile, physiological properties, function, and response to injury and disease. A better understanding of the heterogeneity of astrocytes will greatly aid investigation of the function of astrocytes in normal brain as well as the roles of astrocytes in neurological disorders.},

  abstract = {The functional and molecular similarities and distinctions between human and murine astrocytes are poorly understood. Here, we report the development of an immunopanning method to acutely purify astrocytes from fetal, juvenile, and adult human brains and to maintain these cells in serum-free cultures. We found that human astrocytes have abilities similar to those of murine astrocytes in promoting neuronal survival, inducing functional synapse formation, and~engulfing synaptosomes. In contrast to existing observations in mice, we found that mature human astrocytes respond robustly to glutamate. Next, we performed RNA sequencing of healthy human astrocytes along with astrocytes from epileptic and tumor foci and compared these to human neurons, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells (available at http://www.brainrnaseq.org). With these profiles, we identified novel human-specific astrocyte genes and discovered a transcriptome-wide transformation between astrocyte precursor cells and mature post-mitotic astrocytes. These data represent some of the first cell-type-specific molecular profiles of the healthy and diseased human brain.},
